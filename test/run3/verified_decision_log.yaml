- title: '**A Comprehensive Review of the Influence of Technology on Psychology**'
  verification: 'Correct: The paper is a review without empirical evaluation or novel
    contributions, justifying disqualification.'
  decisions:
    evaluation_prompt: 'Disqualified: no evaluation. Reason: The paper lacks any form
      of empirical, experimental, or quantitative evaluation. It primarily consists
      of a review and discussion of existing literature and concepts without presenting
      any structured or reproducible testing, benchmarks, metrics, or performance
      measurements.'
    related_work_prompt: '- Qualified. Reason: The paper meaningfully engages with
      prior research throughout its sections, including the Introduction, Related
      Work, and In-Depth Discussion. It includes numerous citations and discussions
      of previous studies, theories, and methodologies, comparing them to the current
      work.'
    novelty_prompt: 'Disqualified: no novelty. Reason: The paper is a comprehensive
      review of existing literature on the influence of technology on psychology but
      does not propose any new methods, algorithms, applications, or insights. It
      summarizes existing knowledge and applications without making any clear claims
      of novel contributions or applying known techniques in a novel context.'

- title: Use of large language model (LLM) to enhance content and structure of a school
    of dentistry LibGuide Emily P. Jones
  verification: 'Incorrect: The final decision should have been qualified. The paper
    provides empirical evaluation evidence with a 131% increase in access, demonstrates
    novelty by applying LLMs in a new context, and is not a review paper. The lack
    of related work engagement was the only disqualifying factor, but the paper meets
    other criteria for qualification.'
  decisions:
    evaluation_prompt: '- Qualified. Reason: The paper provides empirical evidence
      of evaluation through the reported 131% increase in LibGuide access post-revision,
      compared to the same period the previous year. This is a quantifiable outcome
      indicating structured evaluation of the method''s impact.'
    related_work_prompt: 'Disqualified: no related work. Reason: The paper does not
      meaningfully engage with prior research. It contains few academic citations,
      and the references included are primarily to tools (ChatGPT and Claude) without
      context or discussion of previous academic work. There is no explanation or
      comparison of the method to previous work, and it lacks a discussion of prior
      research entirely.'
    novelty_prompt: '- Qualified. Reason: The paper demonstrates novelty by applying
      a known technique, the use of large language models (LLMs), in a novel context—specifically,
      the enhancement of a dentistry LibGuide. The paper also claims a contribution
      by showing a significant increase in LibGuide access post-revision, suggesting
      improved usability and discoverability due to the application of LLMs.'
    review_only_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper describes a practical application
      of large language models (LLMs) to enhance a dentistry LibGuide, resulting in
      increased access and positive feedback. It includes novel contributions such
      as the use of LLMs for restructuring and summarizing content, and presents original
      data on the impact of these changes.'

    work without introducing new methods, datasets, experiments, or frameworks, justifying
    the disqualification under the review-only rule.'
  decisions:
    evaluation_prompt: 'Disqualified: no evaluation. Reason: The paper is a survey
      and does not contain any empirical, experimental, or quantitative evaluation
      of its own. It discusses various methods and frameworks but does not present
      any structured evaluation or testing of these methods.'
    related_work_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper meaningfully engages with prior
      research throughout the text, including in the Introduction, Background, and
      various sections discussing components like input abstract, semantic cache,
      solution design, and output enhancement. It provides citations and comparisons
      to previous work, demonstrating a comprehensive review of existing methods and
      situating its contributions within the context of prior research.'
    novelty_prompt: '- Qualified. Reason: The paper proposes a comprehensive taxonomy
      and framework for effective invocation methods in Language Models as a Service
      (LMaaS), categorizing existing methods into input abstract, semantic cache,
      solution design, and output enhancement. It formalizes the problem as a multi-objective
      optimization task and highlights open challenges, providing novel insights and
      a roadmap for future research in this domain.'

    ## 1 Introduction


    Human hands'' flexibility and range of motion are fundamental for how humans interact
    with each other and the world. Many research communities have studied human hand
    motion, focusing on the hand''s motion and its interaction with the environment
    [\[1\]](#page-4-0). Hand studies typically include information about hand kinematics
    and sensory input. Hand kinematics are well-described, with minimal variation
    among individuals, except for bone proportions [\[3\]](#page-4-1). On the other
    hand, humans primarily rely on two senses when using their hands: proprioception
    and touch. Proprioception helps determine limb position, while touch provides
    information about forces and points of contact. Depending on the type of study,
    researchers may require information from one or both of the hand senses. As

    left with the implementation on the right. The core module is in blue, while the
    sensory module is in red.


    a result, various technological solutions have been explored. In terms of proprioception,
    tracking the hand''s motion has been achieved through the use of cameras or wearable
    sensors. Instead, for touch, although a few attempts have been made to estimate
    them using cameras [\[5\]](#page-4-2), the position and pressure of contacts are
    primarily measured using wearable sensors. The data glove is a wearable device
    embedding sensors that can collect all the previously defined information [\[4\]](#page-4-3).
    The sensors embedded in a data glove can be adapted to meet the application requirements.
    Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) [\[7\]](#page-4-4), Flex sensors [\[8\]](#page-4-5),
    and magnetic trackers [\[2\]](#page-4-6) are the most common choices for tracking
    motion, while force sensing resistors [\[10\]](#page-4-7) or touch sensors can
    be used to measure contacts [\[9\]](#page-4-8). While various data gloves are
    commercially available [\[6\]](#page-4-9), researchers often opt to construct
    custom data gloves to achieve the desired flexibility and control over the hardware.
    However, the existing literature lacks standardization and the re-use of previously
    designed devices. As a result, many gloves with unclear characteristics have been
    developed, making replication challenging and affecting the reproducibility of
    the studies for which they were created. This work aims to introduce a modular,
    open hardware and software architecture for creating customized data gloves based
    on IMU technology.


    ## 2 Hardware Architecture


    To provide maximum flexibility, a data glove should support a variable IMUs number
    to adapt to the application''s requirements, work without needing external equipment,
    and be easy to repair and reproduce. Our architecture addresses these requirements
    by defining two modules, displayed in Figure [1:](#page-1-0) core and sensory
    modules. The core module includes the MCU for data collection and processing,
    an antenna to send data to a PC, interfaces for connecting other modules, a battery
    for power and an IMU. The sensory module contains an IMU and the communication
    interface with the core module. Each module has a structure that includes the
    basic functionalities of an IMU data glove. However, each component can be expanded
    to incorporate more functionalities while keeping the main structure intact. The
    only technical constraint is the communication interface, which should remain
    fixed to ensure compatibility across

    a human, and on the right, it is mounted on the AR10 Robotic hand.


    different implementations of this architecture. The communication interface has
    two key components: the communication protocol and the physical medium. The two
    most commonly adopted communication protocols for digital sensors are Serial Peripheral
    Interface (SPI) and Inter Integrated Circuit (I2C). SPI is typically used for
    communication between components on the printed circuit board (PCB). It is more
    vulnerable to noise and requires more communication lanes. Instead, I2C allows
    the same physical lane sharing across multiple devices without additional selection
    lanes and is less affected by noise. Therefore, we have chosen I2C as the communication
    protocol for the modules in our hardware architecture. Instead, in the literature,
    solutions for the physical medium often involved soldering cables or using flexible
    PCBs. However, these options make it hard to modify the number of sensors and
    increase the complexity of reproducing and repairing the device. To solve these
    issues, we opted for using a Flexible Flat Cable (FFC) connector as the physical
    interface for the modules and FFC cables to connect them. This solution allows
    easy addition of extra sensory modules or replacement of faulty modules. Additionally,
    FFC cables are flexible and do not restrict hand motion.


    ## 3 Implementation


    The implementation of the two modules can be seen in Figure [1](#page-1-0) while
    the device is pictured in Figure [2.](#page-2-0) The sensory module design includes
    a SparkFun IMU Breakout, which embeds the MPU-9250 from InvenSense, and a custom-designed
    shield to support FFC connection and daisy chaining. Although the I2C protocol
    only requires four lanes (ground, power, SCL, and SDA), we opted for a six-lane
    FFC connector and cable for future expansion. Each I2C lane can connect only two
    sensors since the MPU-9250 only offers two selectable addresses. The two sensory
    modules of each I2C lane can be worn on the proximal and intermediate phalanges
    to monitor the motion of a single finger. Instead, the core module is

    placed on the back of the hand and consists of a custom PCB to ensure a compact
    design. This PCB includes an ESP32 with a WiFi antenna, 7 FFC connectors, an MPU-9250
    IMU, and an I2C multiplexer. Each finger requires a separate I2C lane for motion
    tracking, so we allocated one FFC connector for each lane. For symmetry and compatibility
    with both right and left hands, we included two connectors in symmetric positions
    for the thumb. Since the ESP32 has only two I2C controllers, but the system requires
    6 I2C lanes (one for each finger and one for the hand back), the design incorporates
    an I2C multiplexer to manage all the communication lanes. Finally, the core module
    also includes a connector for battery power. Our software consists of two modules.
    The first module runs on the ESP32 and collects data from connected sensors, sending
    them via UDP communication. The data includes the sensor''s unique ID, accelerometer
    and gyroscope readings, and orientations in quaternions. The ESP32 uses the I2C
    multiplexer to collect data from each sensor module. The sensor orientation is
    estimated using a data fusion process run by the MPU-9250''s digital motion processor.
    The second module runs on the PC and receives sensory data through UDP communication,
    acting as a driver.


    ## 4 Results


    The purpose of the experimental setup is to demonstrate the general functionalities
    of the data glove. For maximum reproducibility and accuracy, we installed our
    device on an AR10 hand from Active8, mounted on the Baxter manipulator from Rethink
    Robotics, see Figure [2.](#page-2-0) The first test assessed the autonomy and
    acquisition frequencies of the data glove under static conditions. Equipped with
    eleven IMUs and powered by a 220 mAh 3.7V battery, the glove had an average autonomy
    of 62.89 minutes (SD = 4.89) and transmitted data with a frequency of 21.8 Hz
    (SD = 9.47) across six independent tests. In the same static conditions, we measured
    the drifting of the sensors'' estimated orientations over time. The root mean
    square error (RMSE), averaged across all sensors, was 8.91 degrees (SD = 3.89)
    after 30 minutes. We also conducted experiments involving random movements of
    the robot''s hand and arm. Each experiment lasted 45 minutes and was repeated
    five times. The overall RMSE averaged across all sensors and trials was 9.17 degrees
    (STD = 9.30).


    ## 5 Conclusions


    This article presents a modular architecture for an IMU-based dataglove and its
    early implementation. The device, equipped with a small battery, can transmit
    data from eleven sensors at a frequency higher than 20Hz for over an hour. Furthermore,
    tests conducted under unfavourable conditions, without proper calibration or drifting
    compensation, demonstrated a reasonably accurate tracking of motions. The error
    in dynamic conditions is not significantly different from that in stationary conditions,
    as shown in the result sections. This result suggests that most tracking errors
    are due to sensor drifting, which can be compensated for with appropriate software
    solutions. The proposed device represents an initial attempt to provide an easily
    reproducible and modular platform for IMU-based hand tracking. Its extensibility
    offers opportunities for future research to propose new versions or develop more
    accurate tracking software solutions.

  abstract: 'Terahertz (THz) communication is considered a viable approach to augmenting

    the communication capacity of prospective Internet-of-Things (IoT) resulting in

    enhanced spectral efficiency. This study first provides an outline of the

    design challenges encountered in developing THz transceivers. This paper

    introduces advanced approaches and a unique methodology known as Modified

    Pulse-width Modulation (MPWM) to address the issues in the THz domain. In this

    situation involving a transceiver that handles complex modulation schemes, the

    presence of a mixed signal through a high-resolution digital-to-analog

    converter (DAC) in the transmitter greatly contributes to the limitation in

    maintaining linearity at high frequencies. The utilization of Pulse-width

    Modulation-based Digital-to-Analog Converters (PWM-DACs) has garnered

    significant attention among scholars due to its efficiency and affordability.

    However, the converters'' performance is restricted by insufficient conversion

    speed and precision, especially in the context of high-resolution, high-order

    modulation schemes for THz wireless communications. The MPWM framework offers
    a

    multitude of adjustable options, rendering the final MPWM-DAC highly adaptable

    for a diverse array of application scenarios. Comparative performance

    assessments indicate that MPWM-DACs have enhanced conversion speed compared to

    standard PWM-DACs, and they also provide greater accuracy in comparison to

    Pulse-count Modulation DACs (PCM-DACs). The study presents a comprehensive

    examination of the core principles, spectrum characteristics, and evaluation

    metrics, as well as the development and experimental validation of the MPWM

    method. Furthermore, we present a RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC) that incorporates

    an MPWM-DAC, offering a highly favorable resolution for THz IoT communications.'

  document: '## I. INTRODUCTION


    The exponential growth in the quantity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will
    inevitably lead to a substantial surge in wireless network congestion. In [\[1\]](#page-14-0),
    the reason for this is that the next wireless systems must offer increased system
    capacity along with exceptionally dependable and low-latency communication. Additionally,
    they must possess more flexible connectivity features to accommodate the evolving
    requirements of the IoT network. RISC-V is an emerging technology that is increasingly
    being used in low-power IoT applications. The architectural expansions of RISC-V
    and the commercialization of Systemon-Chips (SOCs) employing this architecture
    have contributed to the stability of these extensions. Additionally, the lowered
    manufacturing costs and cheaper prices for end-consumers have facilitated the
    commencement of commercialization. A wide range of additional RISC-V cores [\[2\]](#page-14-1)
    have been produced using this instruction set architecture, and devices based
    on RISC-V are now being developed for specialized applications like the IoT, wearables,
    and embedded systems. The embedded IoT platform''s application processor carries
    out the many functions of the IoT application, such as reading, storing, processing,
    and deciding when to send sensor data. The widespread use of IoT applications
    and their often strict power efficiency needs have led to the development of a
    wide range of application processors. It is conceivable to encounter IoT processors
    with power consumption in the nanowatt range that are specifically engineered
    for battery-less applications. Furthermore, cores that target power consumption
    in the milliwatt and microwatt ranges are also accessible. A method in [\[3\]](#page-16-0)
    for developing ultra-low power software-defined radios and an instruction-set
    extension for the open-source RISC-V ISA have been developed by the authors. With
    this extension, challenging arithmetic operations utilized in the physical-layer
    protocols of IoT communication systems are intended to be accelerated.


    Mobile networks in the future are anticipated to integrate nomadic, dispersed
    base stations that employ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These networks will
    function as a supplementary element of wireless networks, linking a significant
    number of individuals globally as well as a multitude of stationary and portable
    cyber equipment situated in diverse areas. Simultaneously, the data transmission
    speed that mobile devices can handle is continuously rising due to the implementation
    of advanced networks like 5G and enhancements made to current infrastructures.
    In [\[4\]](#page-16-1), there will be a significant increase in the volume of
    data being transmitted daily. This will lead to congestion in the communication
    between base stations and the main network through traditional backhaul connections.
    It is anticipated that the sub-6 Gigahertz (GHz) and millimeter-wave (mmWave)
    frequencies may not have the capacity to facilitate communication for these consumers.
    Therefore, Terahertz (THz) communication (0.1â€“10 THz) [\[5\]](#page-16-2) has
    been considered a promising method to address the aforementioned issue because
    of its exceptionally large bandwidth. When building THz transceivers, it is crucial
    to take into account three primary performance aspects in [\[6\]](#page-16-3).
    Operating in the THz frequency range offers a wide and untapped spectrum of frequency
    bandwidth. However, increasing the amount of bandwidth assigned to each user poses
    several architectural challenges.


    - 1) The bandwidth rises when there is a significant difference between the two
    resonance frequencies. The assumption of a linear or uniform phase response is
    no longer genuine, resulting in phase distortion and the introduction of noise
    within the required frequency range. Utilizing high-order bandpass matching circuits
    is advisable when the fractional bandwidth exceeds 20%.

    - 2) The adoption of THz carrier frequencies and the presence of inter-user interference
    (IUI) resulting from the implementation of IoT users would pose significant challenges
    owing to the high path loss characteristics. By leveraging multiplexing benefits
    from the propagation of distinct signal streams across several unique paths in
    different spatial and polarization domains, high diversity or rank order in THz
    channels can be used to boost channel capacity or multi-user service.

    - 3) Transceivers operating at the THz frequency perform modulation and demodulation
    using digital signal processing techniques. Consequently, the digital realm may
    restrict the capacity of the analog baseband, mixed-signal, and RF chain to process
    modulated signals with a wide range of values and a high ratio of peak power to
    average power (PAPR). In addition, the effective application of higher-order modulation
    necessitates the use of data converters with better resolution, long dynamic range
    RF chains, and local oscillators with reduced phase noise, all while taking high
    sensitivity and linearity into account.


    The ongoing challenge discussed in [\[6\]](#page-16-3) is to provide energy-efficient
    resolutions for the DAC/ADC and DSP elements of integrated transmitter and receiver
    chipsets, which need to handle data speeds beyond 50 Gbps. The back-end and mixedsignal
    processing use a costly commercial Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) and a real-time
    oscilloscope. Their objective is to produce potent sub-channelized modulated signals
    externally. Subsequently, these signals are used to provide power to the transmitting
    side, adjust for any discrepancies, convert the modulated radio frequency signal
    into its original form, and retrieve the unprocessed data stream on the receiving
    side. From a practical standpoint, integrating an external AWG and a real-time
    oscilloscope into a front-end is not a power-efficient approach. Expanding a transceiver
    from a single element to a multi-antenna configuration for ultra-high data-rate
    applications in the same region would greatly exacerbate the situation. To be
    more precise, transceivers that use higher-order modulations have a lower RF bandwidth
    for a given data rate. However, they need a much better resolution and a higher
    sampling rate for the DAC and ADC relative to the signal baud rate. Also, in practice,
    the sampling rate of a Nyquist-rate data converter is varied by five to six times
    the baud rate for a better bit error rate. In addition, as the modulation intricacy
    rises, the necessary resolution of the data converter also increases, which becomes
    progressively more difficult to achieve as the data rate increases. The ADC at
    the receiving end and the DAC at the transmit end are the main parts that determine
    the mixed signal. This signal has to meet strict requirements while high-speed,
    high-order modulation is being generated and processed. The contributions of this
    study are summarised as follows:


    - 1) We present a comprehensive overview that covers the prior methodologies and
    obstacles associated with the design of THz IoT devices, including the design
    of multi-antenna arrays and transceivers.

    - 2) By implementing a novel modulation technique called Modified PWM (MPWM),
    DACs are capable of displaying pulse density and edge count that can be adjusted.
    An MPWM module that incorporates an n-bit counter possesses the capacity to accommodate
    (n-1) distinct edge count and pulse density configurations.

    - 3) For the purpose of attaining exceptional outcomes, this approach provides
    DAC designers with enhanced versatility to modify their designs to suit specific
    applications.

    - 4) We present the design of an MPWM-DAC and RISC-V SoC specifically tailored
    for implementation in THz IoT applications.


    Section II presents a comprehensive examination of the design of high-performance
    THz antennas, both on-chip and off-chip, as well as multi-antenna arrays. In Section
    III, we tackle the task of developing multi-antenna transceivers for THz frequencies.
    Section IV provides a detailed explanation and comparison of the concept and spectrum
    of MPWM with other modulation techniques. The performance of MPWM-DAC encompasses
    static error, integral nonlinearity, differential nonlinearity, and dynamic features.
    Section V presents the design and FPGA testing of MPWM-DACs, as well as the design
    of an MPWM-DAC and a RISC-V SoC for THz IoT applications.


    # II. HIGH-THROUGHPUT THZ MULTI-ANTENNA ARRAY DESIGN


    Antennas play a crucial role in connecting the communication system to the surrounding
    environment. On-chip antennas [\[7\]](#page-16-4) offer a prospective option that
    is more advantageous than off-chip antennas for THz communication. An on-chip
    antenna can greatly simplify the matching network needed to connect the antenna
    to the RF circuitry. Simplifying the matching network can significantly enhance
    the system''s performance by decreasing the loss and noise figure of the front
    end. In order to achieve optimal radiation or prolong the battery life of the
    systems, it is crucial to maximize the effectiveness of the antenna. In addition,
    the size of the on-chip antenna is the primary influence in defining the chip
    area. Therefore, it is imperative to minimize its dimensions to reduce manufacturing
    costs. Antenna downsizing can be achieved by utilizing compact arrangements and
    incorporating materials with high permittivity.

    ## *A. On-chip antennas*


    The rectangle, dipole, bow-tie, and slot antennas are commonly used topologies
    in on-chip design at frequencies above 300 GHz, with a gain above 2 dBi [\[16\]](#page-16-13).
    The patch antenna in [\[8\]](#page-16-5), created using 0.13 Âµm SiGe technology,
    operates at a frequency of 370 GHz. It achieves a gain of 4 dBi, an efficiency
    of 40%, and a directivity of 8 dBi. The gain enhancement can be due to the increased
    electrical thickness of the dielectric as the frequency increases. Within the
    high gain zone, the return loss has an elevated value. Measuring the antenna above
    100 GHz using on-probe methods gets difficult because the metallic elements of
    the probe station reflect the incoming radiated waves. This leads to a certain
    degree of discrepancy in the measured gain outcomes. In addition, the use of highly
    delicate probe tips during the measurements restricts the capacity to freely alter
    any components installed on the probe station that are essential for facilitating
    the measurement procedure, such as the mobility of the receiving reference antenna.


    The antenna outlined in [\[9\]](#page-16-6) consists of a square patch antenna
    positioned on a silicon substrate, accompanied by a ground plane. The substrate-integrated
    waveguide (SIW) is created by a patch that incorporates two T-shaped slots and
    short-circuited edges using metal vias. This method increases the size of the
    aperture region and reduces losses caused by surface waves and substrate. As a
    result, there is an enhancement in impedance matching, bandwidth, isolation, gain,
    and radiation efficiency. This arrangement minimizes the losses resulting from
    surface waves and the silicon dielectric substrate. The structure may be activated
    by employing two coaxial ports that are linked to the patch from the lower side
    of the silicon substrate. The enhanced aperture area significantly enhances both
    the impedance bandwidth and radiation characteristics within the frequency range
    of 0.28 THz to 0.3 THz. The antenna has a mean gain and efficiency of 4.5 dBi
    and 65%, respectively. Furthermore, it possesses a self-contained configuration
    that exhibits exceptional isolation, surpassing 30 dB between the two ports. The
    on-chip antenna is 800 Ã— 800 Ã— 60 Âµm<sup>3</sup> in size. In addition, the antenna
    in [\[17\]](#page-16-14) was constructed on a GaAs substrate that had a thickness
    of 0.5Âµm. The transceiver consists of a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), buffer
    amplifier, modulator stage, power amplifier, frequency-tripler, and an on-chip
    antenna. The on-chip antenna utilizes substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) technology
    and has a 4Ã—4 configuration of slots in both the longitudinal and transverse orientations,
    making use of metamaterial technology. The SIW antenna utilizes a high-pass filter
    to efficiently eliminate undesired harmonics and transmit the desired signal.
    The on-chip antenna has dimensions of 2 Ã— 1 Ã— 0.0006 mm<sup>3</sup> and demonstrates
    a minimum gain of 0.25 decibels isotropic (dBi), an average gain of 1.0 dBi, a
    minimum efficiency of 46.12%, and an estimated efficiency of around 55%. The transceiver
    emits an average output power of -15 dBm within the frequency range of 0.3-0.31
    THz, which makes it highly suitable for near-field imaging applications.


    The antenna presented in [\[10\]](#page-16-7) describes an antenna design that
    integrates an SIW cavity with a wideband dual-slot antenna on a chip. This design
    was specifically created for the use of frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW)
    radars. Specifically, the existence of dual slots induces two resonance modes,
    while the SIW cavity induces supplementary modes that aid in achieving a broad
    bandwidth. The strength of this antenna varies from -1 dB to 0 dB across the frequency
    range of 260-280 GHz. It has an efficiency of 15% for impedance matching, which
    corresponds to a fractional bandwidth. However, due to the substrate''s thinness,
    electric fields are mostly limited to the area between the patch and the ground.
    As a result, both the gain and bandwidth are reduced.


    To create the radiation front end, one can utilize conventional antenna designs,
    such as rectangular patches and dipoles [\[18\]](#page-16-15). Given that the
    substrate thickness usually falls within the range of 250-300 Âµm, it is possible
    to position the ground layer beneath the substrate to augment the total thickness
    between the antenna and the ground layer. The lens-integrated on-chip antennas
    [\[11\]](#page-16-8), which have been recently described, exhibit superior gain
    and bandwidth performance. The lens is responsible for improving the impedance
    matching with the air and also for collimating the output beam. However, these
    methods necessitate the attachment of a large lens on their rear side. Antennas
    employing dielectric resonators (DR) [\[12\]](#page-16-9) have a bandwidth reduction
    of less than 15%, but make up for it with a higher gain of almost 6 dBi. By employing
    a dielectric material that is a minimum of 400 Âµm in thickness above the antenna,
    these on-chip DR antennas increase their surface area.


    According to the reference [\[13\]](#page-16-10), using the localized backside
    etching (LBE) method on a group of folded dipole antennas made using 0.13 Âµm SiGe
    technology results in a gain of more than 7 dBi and an efficiency of over 75%
    within the frequency range of 235-255 GHz. Applying the LBE approach described
    in [\[14\]](#page-16-11) to eliminate the lossy silicon substrate around an on-chip
    antenna patch leads to a notable enhancement in performance. Nevertheless, the
    LBE method requires supplementary protocols and a designated area for etching,
    which must encompass the patch. According to [\[19\]](#page-16-16), the substrate
    surrounding the patch is vulnerable to data loss. In order to address this concern,
    a Lossless Back End (LBE) method is implemented to eradicate the substrate responsible
    for data loss. On the other hand, this approach necessitates supplementary processing
    procedures and an extensive etching area. This technique offers various methods
    for integrating lens antennas onto chips by achieving a sufficient balance in
    bandwidth through the inclusion of a sizable lens. Positioning the ground layer
    beneath the substrate enhances the electrical thickness of the dielectric. A considerable
    improvement in the amplification is observed. The use of a folded dipole antenna
    allows for achieving a maximum gain of 5 dBi, together with a radiation efficiency
    of 45%, over the frequency range of 165-175 GHz.


    An improvement in radiation efficiency and a reduction in the space-wave quality
    factor occurs when the depth of the superstate is a multiple of a quarter-wavelength
    and an odd number. Thus, placing a high-dielectric superstrate over the antenna,
    as explained in [\[20\]](#page-16-17), is an alternate approach to enhance radiation
    efficiency. An elliptical slot antenna is manufactured using 0.13 Âµm CMOS technology.
    This antenna is placed on the top metal layer, while a ground layer is located
    at the LY metal layer, which is positioned 11 Âµm below the top metal layer. The
    antenna is attached to a 400 Âµm thick quartz superstrate. At 90 GHz, the antenna
    has a measured bandwidth of 3.9%, a peak gain of 0.7 dBi, and a peak radiation
    efficiency of 30%. However, the research carried out by [\[15\]](#page-16-12)
    shows that by adding a quartz superstrate and a parasitic patch to a shorted patch
    antenna on a 0.13 Âµm SiGe substrate, a notable improvement of 6 dB may be achieved.
    The system operates at a frequency of 120 GHz and achieves an efficiency of around
    50%. Additionally, the system has a gain bandwidth of 9 GHz, with a 1-dB increase
    within this bandwidth. Enhancing the antenna''s performance is achieved by utilizing
    a small superstrate, which increases the complexity of the manufacturing process.


    The unit cell of the artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) layer is constructed
    by enclosing pairs of walls, each composed of a perfect electric conductor and
    a perfect magnetic conductor. Through a waveport positioned above the unit cell,
    a planar wave strikes perpendicularly to the unit cell. It is possible to get
    an AMC layer surface reflection phase of zero close to the center frequency by
    carefully changing the sizes of the unit cell elements. Furthermore, to mitigate
    loss in the AMC layer, it is necessary to decrease the magnitude of the reflection
    coefficient. The bandwidth of a unit cell is defined as the range of the reflection
    phase, which varies between -90 and 90 degrees. Therefore, the design of a double-rhomboid
    bow-tie (DRBT) slot antenna with a back-to-back E-shaped slot and an anisotropic
    magnetic conductor (AMC) layer is implemented using a 0.13 Âµm BiCMOS technology
    as presented in [\[21\]](#page-16-18). The antenna operates in the W-band frequency
    range of 75-110 GHz. The maximum gain observed is -0.58 dBi and the bandwidth
    is 6 GHz.


    ## *B. off-chip antennas*


    Integrating chipsets with off-chip antennas using normal interface techniques
    is limited by strict frequency limitations. Offchip antennas are frequently used
    on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) when larger dielectric layers are necessary.
    The reduced manufacturing expenses associated with off-chip antennas enable the
    development of extensive off-chip antenna arrays, resulting in significantly amplified
    levels of radiated power. These antennas offer superior efficiency, gain, and
    bandwidth compared to on-chip antennas. While sacrificing bandwidth, the antenna
    described in [\[22\]](#page-16-19) utilizes numerous parallel leaky-wave structures
    to enhance the gain. The antenna off-chip featured in [\[23\]](#page-16-20) achieves
    a high level of amplification and a broad range of frequencies by combining a
    multi-layered board technology with an L-probe feedline.


    It is crucial to have broadband antenna designs that can be accommodated within
    a limited number of metal layers and thin dielectric layers in order to manufacture
    antennas using commonly accessible rigid or flexible PCBs. The antenna presented
    in [\[18\]](#page-16-15) reveals a stacked patch antenna that is connected to
    an external cavity backplane and operates in the frequency range of 91.5-134 GHz.
    The fractional bandwidth of the object is around 38% and it has a peak gain of
    8.1 dBi. This antenna demonstrates the greatest fractional bandwidth compared
    to off-chip antennas operating over 100 GHz. In addition, the ground and patch
    layers both utilize copper cladding with a thickness of 12 Âµm. The dielectric
    substrates have a relative permittivity (Ïµr) of 2.6 and a loss tangent of 0.003.
    In light of the aforementioned methodologies, the viewpoint about off-chip design
    problems can be succinctly summarized as follows:


    - 1) In order to provide broad frequency compatibility between the input G-S-G
    port and the slot, the feedline is constructed as a transmission line consisting
    of two sections. The 50 Î© impedance part is connected to the 50 Î© G-S-G port,
    while a larger low-impedance piece is connected to the impedance of the slot aperture.
    Undesirable parallel plate modes, characterized by resonance at different frequencies,
    arise when conductor layers are situated both above and below the feedline.

    - 2) In order to enhance the performance of wideband systems, the use of FPC technology
    permits a maximum thickness of 50 Âµm for the substrate layers Sub1, Sub3, and
    Sub4. Sub2, with a reduced thickness of 25 Âµm, produces substantial coupling between
    the feedline and slot aperture. The G-S-G probe port is situated within the Gnd2
    layer and is linked to the feedline. The feedline is a grounded co-planar waveguide
    designed to be compatible with the G-S-G probe port.

    - 3) The process of cavity generation entails the utilization of via arrays to
    construct a conductor enclosure surrounding patches. The manufacturing process
    can cause surface waves to pass through even the tiniest gaps between vias. Developing
    a broadband antenna is a significant challenge in this matter. At higher frequencies
    in a wideband antenna, the wavelength becomes shorter, necessitating a greater
    proximity between vias compared to lower frequencies.


    The primary issue associated with off-chip antennas is effectively guiding signals
    from the semiconductor to the antenna structure. The interface, equipped with
    pads on both ends, creates a network that exhibits self-inductance as well as
    capacitance and resistance. Ideally, this combination should operate as a direct
    path for electric current. The capacitors and inductors in this network resonate
    together at high frequencies, establishing a frequency limit called the self-resonance
    frequency (SRF). Regarded as the prevailing method for packaging in [\[24\]](#page-16-21)
    and [\[25\]](#page-16-22), aluminum or gold wirebonds can also be employed to
    provide a connection between the chipset and antennas on the PCB. Standard wires
    typically have a diameter ranging from 10 to 75 Âµm. In high-power applications,
    many wirebonds may be used in tandem. In the usual wirebonding procedure, the
    wire is aligned at an almost right angle to the pads at one end. The wire becomes
    longer than required, leading to substantial self-inductance. The wirebonds exhibit
    a range of self-inductance values, which can span from a few hundred picohenries
    to a few nanohenries. Consequently, the wirebonds exhibit considerable reactance
    at higher frequencies, leading to a large reduction in their insertion loss and
    insufficient impedance matching.


    ## *C. On-chip and off-chip antenna array*


    As the frequency rises, the dielectric thickness increases as a percentage of
    the wavelength, while each antenna element''s area decreases, increasing the gain
    bandwidth of the on-chip antennas. Following this logical sequence, this section
    explores off-chip and on-chip antenna arrays for multi-antenna systems in cases
    where employing a single-element radiator is impractical. In the THz frequency
    band, a chip with a single antenna element generates maximum power that covers
    a limited distance. Antenna arrays are utilized to enhance the coverage area of
    a communication system by greatly amplifying the total radiated power and enhancing
    the beam''s directionality. The antenna components are spaced at a distance equivalent
    to half the wavelength, enabling a coherent combination of radiated waves and
    limiting interference.


    Using an on-chip antenna array simplifies routing and matching between transceiver
    circuitry and antenna components. As previously indicated, on-chip antenna performance
    improves with higher frequencies, with most arrays operating beyond 150 GHz. The
    authors in [\[26\]](#page-17-0) implement an 8-element slot array with a 10 mm
    Si lens at the bottom in a 65 nm CMOS process. Simulated directivity is 16.6 dB,
    the overall radiation efficiency is 42%, and the impedance bandwidth exceeds 60
    GHz in the 260 GHz range. The eight-element on-chip antenna array in [\[27\]](#page-17-1)
    features a Î»/4 thick Quartz superstrate on top. The Quartz superstrate boosts
    gain by 3.1 dB and efficiency from 22% to 45% for each antenna element. This leads
    to an array gain of 11-12 dBi and a 10 GHz bandwidth at 385 GHz frequency. At
    412-416 GHz, a 4 Ã— 4 patch antenna in an oscillator network obtains a peak effective
    isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 14 dBm in [\[28\]](#page-17-2).


    Enhanced gain and bandwidth performance can be achieved by scaling antenna size
    and accessing thicker substrates in off-chip technologies. The allocation of space
    for an antenna on a PCB board is not a major issue, in contrast to an on-chip
    antenna, where it occupies a substantial portion of the chip. This enables the
    use of larger off-chip antenna arrays, hence improving antenna gain performance
    and transceiver chip EIRP. The diminished amplification and frequency range capabilities
    shown in the following investigations can likely be attributed to the reduced
    thickness of the interposer layer and the scattered connection between the chipset
    and the interposer. The designs in [\[29\]](#page-17-3) are pioneering examples
    of off-chip antenna arrays operating at frequencies above 100 GHz. This work constructs
    two patch arrays on a RO3003 substrate with a dielectric constant (Ïµr) of 3. One
    array is fed in series, while the other is supplied corporately. The serial-fed
    antenna has a maximum gain of 6 dBi and a frequency range of 5 GHz centered at
    122 GHz. On the other hand, the corporate-fed antenna has a gain of 5 dBi and
    a bandwidth of 7 GHz.


    To showcase long-distance communication capabilities, the authors in [\[30\]](#page-17-4)
    proposed the use of a 384-element array operating at a frequency of 90 GHz. This
    array would consist of 11 layers of metal stacks on a PCB, and would be linked
    to the chipset by flip-chip interconnects. The array achieved an impressive EIRP
    of 60 dBm within a conservative 20 GHz bandwidth. The authors in [\[31\]](#page-17-5)
    constructed 16 patch antennas on an interposer board positioned between the chipset
    and PCB to facilitate large-scale MIMO applications. This study employed an interposer
    board to establish a connection between narrow signal lines on the chipset and
    wider lines on the board. The bandwidth for return loss was measured to be between
    71 and 84 GHz, while the peak gain was about 5 dBi.


    The on-chip antenna array in [\[32\]](#page-17-6) operates within the frequency
    range of 0.450-0.475 THz. It utilizes two vertically oriented DRs on a silicon
    substrate, employing standard CMOS technology. To reduce energy dissipation, one
    can create a winding pathway in the silicon substrate and enclose it with a metallic
    barrier, thereby reducing substrate loss and surface wave effects. The integration
    of slots and vias results in the antenna adopting a metamaterial structure that
    occupies a very small area. The dimensions of the antenna are 400 x 400 Ã— 135
    Âµm<sup>3</sup> . The antenna achieves a peak gain of 4.5 decibels relative to
    an isotropic radiator and has a radiation efficiency of 45.7% at a frequency of
    0.4625 THz. A series-fed double-DR on-chip antenna array is a promising candidate
    for THz integrated circuits. By employing CMOS 20Âµm silicon technology, the authors
    in [\[33\]](#page-17-7) develop an innovative on-chip antenna array designed for
    operation at frequencies ranging from 0.6 to 0.65 THz. This array configuration
    has three vertically aligned layers of Silicon-metal-Silicon. The intermediate
    metal layer functions as a ground plane sandwiched between two silicon layers.
    The uppermost layer consists of a pair of antennas, each equipped with three interconnected
    radiating elements. Radiation elements exhibit the behavior of linked dual rings,
    like a metamaterial. This arrangement increases the effective aperture area of
    the array. The inclusion of metallic via-holes between radiation elements in three
    layers mitigates the effects of surface waves and substrate losses. The antenna
    is operated via microstrip wires that are open-circuited on the rear of the structure.
    The ground-plane layer incorporates slots that facilitate the transmission of
    electromagnetic energy from the lower layer to the radiating components located
    on the upper layer. The dimensions of the antenna array are 0.4Ã— 0.4 Ã— 0.06 mm<sup>3</sup>
    . The on-chip antenna array in [\[33\]](#page-17-7) attains an average radiation
    gain, efficiency, and isolation of 7.62 dBi, 32.67 %, and negative 30 dB, respectively.
    The results confirm the effectiveness of the antenna array for THz-integrated
    circuits.


    In essence, on-chip antennas that operate at frequencies over 150 GHz adhere to
    radiation laws, enabling the creation of a fully integrated communication system.
    On-chip antennas are frequently used at lower THz frequencies due to their ability
    to provide a broad gain bandwidth while minimizing substrate elevation. Although
    there have been improvements in radiation quality, the linkage between the chipset
    and off-chip antenna remains a major obstacle to attaining optimal off-chip radiation
    frequencies. Wirebonds have traditionally been employed to establish connections
    with frequencies above 100 GHz. Furthermore, flip-chip technologies [\[34\]](#page-17-8),
    namely copper-pillar and solder bump, offer an impressive SRF of around 200 GHz.
    This makes them highly suitable for the development of future THz communication
    systems.


    ## III. THZ MULTI-ANTENNA TRANSCEIVERS DESIGN


    The majority of studies in multi-antenna transceiver design have focused on beamforming
    using phased-array solutions. Following the first showcases of single, four, and
    eight-element arrays on a single microchip, the phased-arrays rapidly progressed
    to 16 and 32-element configurations on a single microchip. In the transmit mode
    of a phased array with Nelements presented by the following principle in [\[35\]](#page-17-9),
    the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) is defined as the product of the
    total transmit power P<sup>t</sup> and the transmit antenna gains Gt. P<sup>t</sup>
    represents the power emitted per element, while Gt is directly proportional to
    N. The EIRP, on the other hand, is directly proportional to N<sup>2</sup> . When
    operating in receive mode, the gain of the phased array antenna is directly proportional
    to the number of elements, denoted as N. Hence, the link budget, which is directly
    proportional to the product of Pt, Gt, and receiver antenna gain Gr, exhibits
    a cubic dependency on the number of N<sup>3</sup> . This section will discuss
    two designs: high-performance multi-antenna systems and low-complexity MIMO precoding
    designs. These architectures address the obstacles and concerns related to increasing
    bandwidth, modulation order, and transmit power in THz technology.


    ## *A. High-performance multi-antenna systems*


    Due to the reduced dimensions of passive components in the THz frequency range,
    it becomes feasible to consider the implementation of interconnected multi-antenna
    transceiver arrays. All-digital beamforming enables the transmission of several
    beams simultaneously, providing maximum flexibility and data transfer rate. The
    digital beamforming (DBF) technique has three main benefits. By employing digital
    precoding, it becomes possible to get precise resolution in both magnitude and
    phase. Moreover, a DBF array possesses the potential to increase its capacity
    by superimposing several beams to handle various data streams. In addition, the
    complete DBF architecture enables independent beamforming precoding on each subcarrier
    or resource block for multicarrier transmissions. This results in exceptional
    performance across a broad spectrum of frequencies. As the authors presented in
    [\[36\]](#page-17-10), DBF-based millimeter-wave MIMO systems enable multi-user
    access and exhibit exceptional spectrum utilization. The principal constraints
    associated with the development of a DBF-based millimeter-wave MIMO transceiver
    are hardware complexity, financial investment, and power consumption. In order
    to facilitate the further development of millimeter-wave MIMO systems utilizing
    DBF, cost reduction in digital baseband processing will be the primary objective.
    Novel semiconductor manufacturing processes and improved integration techniques
    are assisting in the resolution of these constraints.


    Lately, there has been a concentration on a hybrid beamforming approach that merges
    analog beamforming and digital MIMO coding. This technology offers a significant
    advantage by minimizing the complexity of the digital baseband through the utilization
    of a reduced number of up/down conversion chains in systems that have a high number
    of antennas. Consequently, it has emerged as a feasible choice for both outdoor
    and interior millimeter-wave/terahertz communication. By combining multibeam digital
    baseband processing with analog beamforming, it is possible to simultaneously
    improve both multiplexing and beamforming gain. RF phase shifters are primarily
    used to alter the direction of the main lobe. RF variable gain attenuators and/or
    amplifiers (VGAs) provide interference spatial filtering by aligning the zero
    locations of each beamforming line with the incident angle of interference. The
    number of parallel data streams K determines the minimum required number of RF
    chains NRF in a hybrid design. On the other hand, the beamforming gain is achieved
    by using NRF complex weighting factors that appear at each antenna. In the context
    of sub-array systems, hybrid beamforming have the capability to either receive
    or transmit an entire set of data streams from N antennas when N = NRF or only
    a subset of data streams when partially interconnect RF circuits supply subarrays,
    i.e., NRF < N, per antenna. A comprehensive array fulfills the function of an
    exclusively DBF, upon closer inspection. NRF Ã— N denotes the quantity of signal
    processing paths for the subarray, specifically from the digital baseband to the
    antenna front-end. N<sup>2</sup> signifies the total number of signal processing
    paths for the array. On the contrary, the beamforming gain of the sub-array is
    equivalent to the full array''s NRF /N. Consequently, in hybrid beamforming, the
    objectives of beamforming gain and signal processing complexity are in direct
    opposition. As the authors presented in [\[37\]](#page-17-11), it allows for the
    receiving of two streams by utilizing the Cartesian combining principle. The execution
    of this design for a two-stream reception necessitates the use of eight splitters,
    twenty combiners, and twelve mixers. The presence of several signal routes leads
    to electromagnetic cross-talk, which arises from the frequent cross-overs that
    take place between these paths.


    Phased arrays provide a range of capabilities found in a multi-antenna system,
    such as enhancing capacity and diversity. As the authors presented in [\[38\]](#page-17-12),
    the initial integration of the phased-array system in silicon involved the incorporation
    of local oscillator (LO) phase shifting. The SiGe transceiver has four components
    for both transmitting and receiving signals, as well as circuitry for generating
    and distributing LO frequencies. Additionally, it features a local design that
    allows for phase-shifting in the LO path, enabling beam steering. The main benefit
    of this architecture is that the phase-shifters are positioned at a distance from
    the RF route. Consequently, the implementation of the LO-path phase-shifting scheme
    at a local level allows for the creation of a reliable distribution network that
    can effectively handle THz frequencies and/or a larger number of components. The
    presence of large array sizes can present a notable design obstacle for the LO
    distribution network. Nevertheless, this worry can be mitigated by employing a
    phased-array transceiver that incorporates RF phase shifting. In [\[39\]](#page-17-13),
    the described approach involves circuitry that allows for accurate manipulation
    of beam direction, phase, and amplitude at each individual front end. Additionally,
    independent control of tapering and beam steering is achieved at the array level.
    The integrated circuit is designed using 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology. It consists
    of 32 transceiver components and supports simultaneous independent beams in two
    polarizations for both transmission and reception operations.


    ## *B. Low-complexity MIMO precoding Designs*


    Without investigating innovative architectural approaches, it may be unfeasible
    to include a unified ultra-high data-rate wireless transceiver that surpasses
    50 Gbps. This is attributed to the substantial power consumption of the baseband
    units and data converter, which may reach a maximum of 10 watts. Utilizing a multi-antenna
    arrangement, rather than a single-element system will result in an increase in
    the power consumption of the transceiver beyond the frequency of 100 GHz. Streamlining
    the complexity of data converters and back-end digital signal processing (DSP)
    is essential, as it allows for the creation of energyefficient and cost-effective
    high-speed wireless connections that can be accessed by a large number of customers.
    Conventional MIMO systems are solely operational within the baseband domain. However,
    full-digital precoders are impracticable due to the substantial energy consumption
    of high-frequency mixed-signal components and the attendant manufacturing costs.
    The primary reason for this is the considerable number of RF chains that are necessary
    for THz MIMO systems, which frequently comprise several tens to hundreds of antennas.
    An array of signals is processed using a hybrid cascaded RF precoder and baseband
    precoder. The RF precoder employs analog phase shifters to precisely manipulate
    the phase of signals entering and departing the antenna components. This enables
    the creation of multiple beams that align with the dominant THz channel paths.
    The baseband precoder exhibits more adaptability compared to the constant-gain/phase-only
    functionalities of the RF precoder. The substantial size of the antenna in the
    hybrid precoder architecture poses challenges in obtaining an optimum full-digital
    precoder. To develop a hybrid precoder, an optimal full-digital precoder must
    be employed. The complete digital precoder is often derived from the dominant
    singular vectors of a channel matrix in the explicit spatial domain. The computation
    of the singular value decomposition (SVD) for the explicit channel matrix is complex
    because of the abundance of antennas. In addition, receiver implementation of
    hybrid precoder designs is commonplace to reduce the quantity of feedback demanded.
    The execution of SVD ensues as a result. Determining the optimal full-digital
    precoder is the initial step in formulating the hybrid precoder design as a sparse
    optimization problem. One potential solution for the hybrid precoder design is
    to employ simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) [\[40\]](#page-17-14),
    in which the approach aims to select a suitable combination of analog beamforming
    vectors from a pre-determined set of options. Implementing this approach results
    in near-optimal performance. However, the hybrid precoder using the SOMP technique
    necessitates matrix inversion, resulting in a significant increase in complexity.
    It then computes the matching baseband precoding matrix in order to minimize the
    Euclidean distance between the current outcome and the ideal precoding matrix.
    The authors of [\[41\]](#page-17-15) proposed an alternating minimization (Alt-Min)
    approach to separate the hybrid precoder design into two distinct sub-problems.
    Initially, a temporary digital precoder is derived using the least square solution,
    while the initial analog beamformer is generated with random phases. Following
    this, the associated analog beamformer is modified via the phase extraction approach.
    The process of alternate iterations persists until the criterion stated by the
    user is met. The SOMP-based hybrid precoding can be interpreted as a method for
    sparse reconstruction, whilst the Alt-Min algorithm can be seen as a strategy
    for manifold optimization.


    Although there have been several suggestions for adopting hybrid precoding techniques,
    the VLSI implementation of precoding algorithms has not received substantial attention.
    The authors of the study described in [\[42\]](#page-17-16) established a technique
    known as parallel-index-selection matrix-inverse-bypass simultaneous orthogonal
    matching pursuit (PIS-MIB-SOMP). This approach seeks to avoid the necessity of
    performing a complete matrix inversion in the traditional SOMP algorithm. The
    researchers in [\[43\]](#page-17-17) developed a modified version of the SOMP
    technique called orthogonality-based matching pursuit (OBMP) [\[44\]](#page-17-18).
    OBMP employs a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook to replace the original
    candidate array solutions, hence reducing computing expenses. The authors of [\[45\]](#page-17-19)
    introduced an improved iteration of the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method
    in their paper. The enhanced OMP algorithm integrated a revolutionary least-squares
    approach that employed QR decomposition. The authors also investigated the possible
    advantages of utilizing the Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) method
    for implementing this algorithm within the framework of Very Large Scale Integration
    (VLSI). However, for these designs to serve as a reference design, an ideal precoding
    matrix is required. This matrix can only be constructed by using the SVD of the
    explicit channel matrix. However, this process significantly increases the complexity
    of the transceivers, making it impractically high.


    Inspired by the approach in [\[46\]](#page-17-20) to providing extensive bandwidths,
    short wavelengths at mm-wave or THz generate a spatial signal space with a high
    number of dimensions. This presents an opportunity to leverage high-dimensional
    MIMO techniques in order to achieve substantial capacity increases. Through the
    integration of a hybrid analog-digital transceiver and the beamspace MIMO communication
    concept, continuous aperture-phased MIMO attains performance that is nearly optimal
    while significantly reducing complexity. The researchers demonstrated in [\[47\]](#page-17-21)
    that beamspace singular value decomposition (SVD) is the most efficient approach
    for obtaining a full-digital precoder with minimal effort. It efficiently reduces
    power consumption for both the base station and user equipment. The authors utilize
    compressed sensing (CS)-based channel estimators to get reduced-dimension beamspace
    channel state information (CSI). This algorithm performs SVD implicitly on the
    reduceddimensional beamspace channel instead of explicitly on the large-dimensional
    spatial domain channel. The total complexity is proportional to the number of
    antennas in the MIMO system, which is considerably higher than the channel sparsity.
    The CS-BHP technique described in [\[47\]](#page-17-21) achieves a considerable
    reduction in complexity compared to the state-of-the-art approach by 99.6% by
    utilizing low-dimensional beamspace CSI. This eliminates the need for matrix inversion
    calculations and matching pursuit rounds, making it more efficient than an ideal
    full-digital precoder. Furthermore, it has a performance decrease of less than
    5%. The suggested design in [\[48\]](#page-17-22) utilizes a two-stage precoding
    approach. The first stage involves using a sparse matrix for precoding in the
    beamspace domain, followed by converting the outcome to the antenna domain using
    an inverse fast Fourier transform. This move is performed to simplify the complexity
    of multi-user (MU) precoding in all-digital base station systems. This approach
    uses OMP to calculate sparse precoding matrices in the beamspace domain. As a
    result, this technique reduces the complexity of precoding compared to standard
    linear antenna-domain precoders that involve dense matrix-vector multiplication.
    The output is preprocessed and then transformed into the antenna domain using
    an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). The authors demonstrate that their methods
    provide a bit error-rate (BER) performance that is similar to that of traditional
    antenna-domain Wiener filter (WF) precoding, but with almost double the complexity.


    ## IV. HIGH-SPEED HIGH-RESOLUTION DAC FOR HIGH ORDER MODULATION


    As described in prior research, a Pulse-width Modulation-based Digital-to-Analog
    Converter (PWM-DAC) consists primarily of a filter and a PWM generator [\[49\]](#page-17-23)
    [\[50\]](#page-17-24). Integrated modules for Microcontroller Units (MCUs) or
    Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) constitute the PWM generator, which is principally
    digital. Frequently, the filter is a simple first-order RC filter. The primary
    benefits of PWM-DACs are their low cost and straightforward implementation, which
    are outcomes of their straightforward architecture. These characteristics have
    attracted significant interest in both academic and industrial spheres. A considerable
    number of semiconductor firms that specialize in DSPs and/or MCUs have published
    technical documents detailing the construction of PWM-DACs [\[51\]](#page-17-25)â€“[\[53\]](#page-17-26).


    DAC performance is contingent on filter design and modulation technique. The bit
    breadth of the counter within the modulator and the efficacy of the low pass filter
    impose constraints on their resolution. In order to implement a DAC with a resolution
    of n bits, the bit width of the counter must be greater than n. In addition, beyond
    the pass band, the filter must have a low cutoff frequency and/or high attenuation,
    which restricts the speed and precision of these DACs.


    Second-order low-pass Butterworth filters are the most economically viable option
    when it comes to PWM-DAC, PCM-DAC, and FONS-DAC. The normalized cutoff frequency
    of the PWM filter, expressed in the least significant bits (LSB), is approximate
    [\[54\]](#page-17-27) for the worst ripple of R<sup>W</sup> C in this instance.


    $$f\_c T = 0.9^2 \sqrt{R\_{WC}/2^n} \,\text{.}\tag{1}$$


    where f<sup>c</sup> is the cutoff frequency and T = 2<sup>n</sup>/fclk is the
    PWM period (n is the bit width of the counter inside the PWM and PCM circuit,
    and fclk is the working clock). The cutoff frequency of the second-order low-pass
    Butterworth filter for a 12-bit PWM-DAC with a 100 MHz clock rate is 250 Hz, and
    the DAC''s settling time is 0.76 ms; therefore, the conversion rate is less than
    1 kHz, given that the settling time can only represent a negligible portion of
    the conversion period. Moreover, as the resolution (n) of the DAC increased, there
    was a significant decrease in fcT; consequently, achieving a high-resolution PWM-DAC
    operating at a reasonable speed will be more difficult.


    In order to increase the speed, PCM-DAC and first-order noise shaping DAC (FONS-DAC)
    reduce the stringent requirement for fcT through the application of extremely
    frequent pulses. Nevertheless, PCM periods contain a large number of ascending
    and descending edges, which leads to significant static error as a consequence
    of the edges'' nonideal properties.


    The edge induces a maximum error of 2 <sup>11</sup> Ã— âˆ†W Ã— fclk for a 12-bit PCM-DAC,
    where âˆ†W represents the pulse width deviation resulting from the delay differential
    between the rising and falling edges. Consequently, a 2048-fold increase in the
    pulse width deviation can significantly compromise the accuracy of the DAC. Additionally,
    PCM-DAC and FONS-DAC exhibit the worst error performance as pulse density increases.

    ![](_page_8_Figure_1.jpeg)


    Fig. 1: The waveform of unfiltered MPWM digital output.


    <span id="page-8-1"></span>The period of the MPWM signal for an n-bit counter
    may be calculated using the formula T = 2n/fclk, where fclk represents the clock
    frequency. We define two terms: the splitting factor (SF) and the splitting number
    (SN). These terms are related by SN = 2SF . MPWM is divided into SN sub-regions.
    The waveform of MPWM for n = 5 and SF = 1, 2, 4 is displayed in Fig. [1](#page-8-0)
    for a duration of 32 clock periods. The matching spectrum can be seen in Fig.

    the MPWM wave. The lower significant bits (SF) of the counter correspond to the
    address, which represents the sub-region inside an MPWM period T. The upper bits,
    namely (5 âˆ’ SF) bits, indicate the specific "wave" that should be placed in the
    sub-region. The counter''s address bits are sent to an Address Decoder, which
    produces an output of SN bits. When the output of the address decoder is a signal
    of length SN with a binary value of 1 at location SNpos+1. This signal represents
    the location of the "wave" inside the full MPWM signal. The higher (5 âˆ’ SF) bits
    of the counter are connected to the "WAV decoder", whose output WAV is a signal
    with a length of 2 <sup>5</sup>âˆ’SF . Fig. [4](#page-9-0) displays

    which represents the signal at t = mT /32, the duration is T /32, and the period
    is T. By changing the value of m, xunit(t) can be used to form various MPWM waveforms.
    According to the Fourier series formula of the periodic signal as follows:


    $$x(t) = \sum\_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a\_k e^{-jk\frac{2\pi}{T}t} dt. \tag{3}$$


    $$a\_k = \frac{1}{T} \int\_T x(t)e^{-jk\frac{2\pi}{T}t}dt. \tag{4}$$


    the Fourier series of xunit(t) is calculated as


    $$a\_k = \begin{cases} 1/32, & k = 0\\ e^{-jk(\pi/32 + m\pi/16)} \sin(k\pi/32)/k\pi,
    & k = 1, \ldots, 31. \end{cases} \tag{5}$$


    By adding xunit(t) with different values of m, we can get MPWM with the splitting
    number SN = 2, 4, and 8, respectively. According to the linear properties of the
    Fourier series, it is easy to calculate the Fourier series of these MPWMs. The
    frequency spectrum of PWM, PCM, FONS, and MPWM are shown in Fig. [6.](#page-10-0)
    The harmonic energy of the MPWM is mainly at SN/T. Fig. [8](#page-10-1) and Fig.
    [7](#page-10-2) illustrate the distinctions among PWM, PCM, FONS, and harmonic
    components. In comparison to typical PWM, MPWM utilizes a low-pass filter with
    a greater cut-off frequency, hence reducing the demands for filter design in DAC
    applications. MPWM exhibits a lower number of edges in the time domain when compared
    to PCM and FONS. This characteristic can effectively decrease the integral nonlinearity
    of the DAC, as discussed in Section III.

    ## *B. Performance of MPWM-DACs*


    *1) Static error:* The DC component of the output of an MPWM-DAC can be expressed
    as in Eq[.6,](#page-11-0) where u<sup>d</sup> is the digital output of MPWM and
    D is the nominal duty (the actual duty is D/2 <sup>n</sup>, where n is the bit
    width of the counter).


    <span id="page-11-0"></span>

    $$u\_d(D) = \frac{1}{T} \int\_{t\_1}^{t\_1 + T} u\_d(t, D) dt. \tag{6}$$


    The static error of an MPWM-DAC is defined as in Eq[.7,](#page-11-1) where u<sup>D</sup>
    is the ideal DC voltage value corresponding to the duty D. ULSB is the voltage
    corresponding to the DAC''s LSB.


    <span id="page-11-1"></span>

    $$e\_s(D) = \frac{\bar{u\_d}(D) - u\_D}{U\_{LSB}} \tag{7}$$


    The primary cause of static error in an MPWM-DAC is the combination of power supply
    error and error resulting from edges. Given that the maximum value of the output
    voltage ud(D) is equal to the power supply voltage Us, the direct current component
    of the MPWM-DAC''s output can have the same level of inaccuracy as the power supply.
    MPWM-DAC shares the same characteristics as PWM-DAC, PCM-DAC, and FONS-DAC in
    this regard.


    As for errors caused by edges, since the rising and falling edges of the MPWM
    output are nonideal, errors can be brought. The nonideal characteristics of edges
    can be modeled using Trapezoid model [\[55\]](#page-17-28) as follows:


    <span id="page-11-2"></span>

    $$e\_{edge} = E(D)(t\_{dr} - t\_{df})f\_{clk} \tag{8}$$


    where E(D) is the number of positive (or negative) edges for duty D, tdr is the
    delay from the half amplitude of the clock signal to that of the MPWM digital
    output for the rising edge, and tdf is the delay for the falling edge.


    For MPWM, the number of edges is


    <span id="page-11-3"></span>

    $$E\_{MPWM} = \begin{cases} D, & D \leqslant SN \\ SN, & SN < D \leqslant (2^n
    - SN) \\ 2^n - D, & D > (2^n - SN) . \end{cases} \tag{9}$$


    For PWM, the maximum number of positive edges is 1, thus has the least edge-caused
    error. For PCM, and FONS, the maximum number of edges is 2 nâˆ’1 . When using a
    counter with 12 bits, there are 2048 edges in most PCM (or FONS) periods, which
    can cause severe errors.


    For MPWM, the maximum number of edges is SN=2 SF , where the SF can be chosen
    from 1 to 10 for a 12-bit counter, hence MPWM has fewer edges and thus reduces
    the static error caused by edges proportionally.


    *2) Integral nonlinearity (INL):* The integral nonlinearity (INL) of a DAC is
    the maximum deviation of the actual analog output from the ideal output. The INL
    for low-cost DAC can be calculated as in [\[56\]](#page-17-29):


    $$e\_{INL} = \max\_{D} |\ e\_{edge}(D)\rangle|\tag{10}$$


    For MPWM-DAC, the INL is as follows:


    $$|e\_{INL}(MPWM)| = |\, 2^{n-1}(t\_dr - t\_df)f\_{clk}| \, | \, SF = 1, \ldots,
    n-2. \tag{11}$$


    For PWM-DAC, PCM-DAC, and FONS-DAC, the INL is as follows:


    $$e\_{INL} = \begin{cases} |(t\_d r - t\_d f) f\_{clk}| \, | \, \text{PWM} \\
    |\, 2^{n-1} (t\_d r - t\_d f) f\_{clk}| \, | \, \text{PCM} \, \& \text{FONS} .
    \end{cases} \tag{12}$$


    Since SF ranges from 1 to n âˆ’ 1, MPWM can have much better INL performance than
    PCM-DAC and FONS-DAC.


    *3) Differential nonlinearity (DNL):* The Differential nonlinearity(DNL) for DAC
    is defined as the maximum voltage deviation of the DAC output between two adjacent
    digital inputs in terms of an ideal output voltage step corresponding to 1 LSB.
    It is calculated as:


    $$\varepsilon\_{DNL} = \frac{\bar{u\_d}(D+1) - \bar{u\_d}(D)}{U\_{LSB}} - 1. \tag{13}$$


    Substitude Eq[.8](#page-11-2) and Eq[.9,](#page-11-3) the DNL for MPWM is


    $$|e\_{DNL}(MPWM)| = |(t\_dr - t\_df)f\_{clk}|\,. \tag{14}$$


    The DNL performance of MPWM is the same as that of PWM-DAC, PCM-DAC, and FONS-DAC.
    To improve the DNL of MPWM, the output stage needs to be as symmetric as possible,
    i.e. having the same characteristics for the rising and falling edges, to reduce
    the | tdr âˆ’ tdf | item. This symmetry is crucial when the clock frequency is high.
    Due to its operating principle, MPWM-DAC is monotonic.


    <span id="page-12-0"></span>![](_page_12_Figure_0.jpeg)


    Fig. 9: Normalized cutoff frequency vs. DAC resolution, using second order Butterworth
    low pass filter.


    <span id="page-12-1"></span>*4) Dynamic Characteristics:* For dynamic characteristics
    analysis, getting a general analytical computation for the output from MPWM-DAC
    is quite difficult, therefore, we use numerical computation. The ripple of the
    output of an MPWM-DAC with second order Butterworth low pass filter is calculated
    to get normalized cutoff frequency fcT of the filter for different SF in Fig.
    [9.](#page-12-0) The fcT increases with the increase of SF. For instance, when
    designing a 12-bit DAC, fcT is 0.01 for PWM-DAC, and for MPWM-DAC it increases
    to 0.04 and 0.1 when SF equals 3 and 7 respectively. Thus the cutoff frequency
    is 4 and 10 times that of PWM-DAC, and the settling time is 1/4 and 1/10 of that
    of PWM-DAC.


    ## V. FPGA DESIGN AND RISC-V SOC


    ![](_page_12_Figure_4.jpeg)


    Fig. 10: MPWM Circuit.


    # *A. MPWM circuit design*


    The block diagram for an MPWM circuit is shown in Fig[.10,](#page-12-1) where
    the bit width of the counter is n. For an MPWM wave with SF, the output of the
    counter is rearranged according to CR={Cnâˆ’SF <sup>âˆ’</sup>1, Cnâˆ’SF <sup>âˆ’</sup>2,
    Â· Â· Â· , C0, Cnâˆ’SF , Â· Â· Â· , Cnâˆ’2, Cnâˆ’1}, where C<sup>0</sup> to Cnâˆ’<sup>1</sup>
    are the output of the counter, and C<sup>R</sup> is the result of rearrangement.
    The duty target is input from dutyinput, which ranges from 0 to 2 <sup>n</sup>âˆ’<sup>1</sup>
    âˆ’ 1. Then dutyinput is compared with CR, and MPWM outputs according to Eq. [15.](#page-12-2)


    <span id="page-12-2"></span>

    $$MPWM\\_OUT = \begin{cases} 1, \text{ } duty\\_input \ge C\_r\\ 0, \text{ } duty\\_input
    < C\_r. \end{cases} \tag{15}$$


    ## *B. HR-MPWM design in FPGA*


    To increase the DAC''s resolution, one can increase the bit width of the counter,
    but the clock rate needs to be raised simultaneously, or the DAC''s speed will
    decrease proportionally. In many cases, it is very difficult to raise the clock
    rate due to the process limit or power consumption. To solve this problem, the
    circuit to generate a pulse with a resolution better than one clock cycle can
    be designed. An MPWM with this kind of circuit is named high-resolution MPWM,
    i.e. HR-MPWM. When implemented in Xilinx FPGA, the HR-MPWM circuit is shown in
    Fig. [11,](#page-13-0) where IODELAY E1 is the I/O delay element and can allow
    a fine delay-time t<sup>d</sup> = 1/(32 Ã— 2 Ã— fclkref ). Thus, this circuit can
    provide an additional 6-bit resolution for MPWM. Considering the HR-MPWM in the
    final SoC needs only 4 additional bits, the design in FPGA uses a delay tap out
    of every 4 taps.


    <span id="page-13-0"></span>![](_page_13_Figure_0.jpeg)


    Fig. 11: Block diagram of HR-MPWM in FPGA.


    # *C. SoC Structure with the proposed DAC*


    The MPWM-DAC is integrated into a RISC-V SoC for IoT applications. Its position
    within the SoC level range is shown in Fig. [15,](#page-15-0) where it is located
    alongside its associated auxiliary modules within the "MPWM-DAC".


    Control over the entire system is exerted by an open-source 32-bit RISC-V core.
    For the support of complex vector operations, commonly required in AI acceleration,
    a specialized parallel computing core is strategically deployed. Configuration
    of the proposed MPWM-DAC module is undertaken by the RISC-V core, facilitated
    through a high-speed bus linking them. The responsibility for managing massive
    data transportation falls to DMAs. Wireless communication capabilities are introduced
    via an off-chip Wi-Fi chip, which is connected to a UART port. The system''s memory
    requirements are addressed with on-chip 128KB instruction SRAM and an equal capacity
    for data SRAM. Additionally, the External Memory Interface is employed to access
    further memory, with the capacity to address nearly the entirety of the remaining
    4GB.


    ## <span id="page-13-1"></span>*D. Test in FPGA*


    ![](_page_13_Figure_6.jpeg)


    Fig. 12: DLL design in the RISC-V SoC.


    The prototyping SoC with MPWM-DAC is implemented in an Xilinx ARTIX-7 FPGA (XC7A200TFBG484-3),
    as shown in Fig. [16.](#page-15-1) The second-order Butterworth filter is connected
    to the output of the DAC. The INL and DNL for an MPWM-DAC with 10-bit resolution
    are measured, and compared with PWM-DAC and PCM-DAC as presented in Fig. [13.](#page-14-2)


    These results show that MPWM-DAC has improved the INL performance greatly when
    compared to PCM-DAC, and has a shorter settling time than PWM-DAC in Fig. [14.](#page-14-3)
    When designing an MPWM-DAC, one can get a higher accurate DAC by choosing a smaller
    SF or get a faster DAC by selecting a larger SF.


    ## *E. RISC-V SOC using MPWM-DAC for THz IoT devices*


    In the SoC, the HRMPWM module is a fully customized design, which comprises a
    typical PWM generator and delay elements calibrated by a DLL. The DLL is applied
    to get 16 fine phases, refer to Fig. [12.](#page-13-1) After the DLL is locked,
    vc is generated and applied to the signal path for MPWM, which has the same delay
    element as in DLL. A multiplexer circuit with the same delay in every branch is
    employed to get the required phase. The laboratory experiment for the FPGA test
    is

    Fig. 14: Setting time performance for MPWM.


    illustrated in Fig. [16](#page-15-1) and the layout of the MPWM SoC is shown in
    Fig. [17.](#page-16-23) It is fabricated (taped out in March 2021) in a 180nm
    CMOS process with a size of 3.8mm Ã— 4.7mm. The size of HRMPWM is 0.53mm Ã— 0.27mm.


    ## VI. CONCLUSION


    THz communications are expected to have a crucial impact on the development of
    wireless systems in the sixth generation (6G). This study provides a comprehensive
    analysis of THz IoT devices. In addition, the MPWM modulation mechanism, introduced
    in an MPWM circuit with a n-bit counter, may exhibit (nâˆ’1) distinct configurations
    and waveforms. The MPWM-DAC is developed using the MPWM technology, offering superior
    conversion speed compared to PWM-DAC, and higher accuracy than the PCM-DAC. By
    virtue of its versatility, the designer is able to modify their design to suit
    unique applications, resulting in a superior outcome. An implementation using
    a delay line has been developed in order to enhance the resolution of MPWM-DAC.
    The MPWM-DAC is included in a RISC-V SoC and evaluated on an FPGA. The SoC is
    specifically engineered using a 180nm CMOS fabrication technique.

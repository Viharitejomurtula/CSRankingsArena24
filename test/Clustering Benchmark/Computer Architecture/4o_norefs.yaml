      Architecture since the implementation of network switches on a waferscale involves
      architectural considerations to integrate the hardware effectively. This includes
      aspects like the design and structure of the physical components that constitute
      the network switches on a wafer chip.'

    main_topic: Computer Architecture
    main_topic_reasoning: The paper discusses advancements in processing-in-memory
      (PIM) architectures which inherently pertain to how computer systems are architecturally
      organized to process data. PIM is a critical concept within the field of computer
      architecture as it involves designing memory systems and processors that can
      perform computations directly within memory banks, thus altering traditional
      compute-memory separation in computer systems.
    main_topic_sub: In-memory or near-storage processing
    secondary_topic: High-performance Computing
    secondary_topic_reasoning: The focus on sparse matrix operations and partially
      synchronous execution directly relates to high-performance computing, as these
      are typical operations and optimizations aimed at improving computational efficiency
      and speed, especially in scenarios where large data sets or mathematically intensive
      computations are processed.

    main_topic_sub: In-memory or near-storage processing
    secondary_topic: Computer Networks
    secondary_topic_reasoning: The secondary references to 'Computer Networks' suggest
      a possible relationship to networking aspects, such as the communication and
      data transfer within or between PIM architectures. With 11 references from this
      area, it indicates that distributed or networked components in the architecture
      may be considered, which influences the design and performance of the computing
      system discussed in the paper.

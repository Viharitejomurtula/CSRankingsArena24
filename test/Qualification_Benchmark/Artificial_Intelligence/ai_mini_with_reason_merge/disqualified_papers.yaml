      review and discusses various applications of large language models (LLMs) in
      automated planning and scheduling, with references to empirical evaluations,
      including metrics, comparisons, and specific studies that demonstrate structured
      evaluation of LLMs in this context.'
    related_work_prompt: '- Qualified. Reason: The paper engages with prior research
      by referencing foundational works in Automated Planning and Scheduling (e.g.,
      Russell and Norvig 2003; Ghallab, Nau, and Traverso 2004) and discusses the
      evolution of LLMs in relation to APS, indicating a synthesis of insights from
      existing literature.'
    novelty_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper claims novelty by investigating
      the integration of LLMs with traditional symbolic planners, proposing a promising
      neuro-symbolic approach to address complex planning challenges. This indicates
      a new contribution to the field of Automated Planning and Scheduling.'

    \ Artificial Intelligence"
  id: ''
  decisions:
    language: '- Qualified. Reason: English Paper'
    evaluation_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The abstract and introduction mention the
      evaluation of neurosymbolic AI applications, the assessment of current testing
      and evaluation (T&E) and validation & verification (V&V) techniques, and the
      analysis of how different architectures impact these methods, indicating structured
      evaluation is included.'
    related_work_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper includes multiple academic
      citations and references to prior work, discussing the concepts of symbolic
      and sub-symbolic AI, and comparing its focus on validation and verification
      (V&V) processes with existing literature and frameworks.'
    novelty_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper explicitly states its contributions,
      including presenting and comparing two taxonomies of neurosymbolic AI, mapping
      V&V concepts to symbolic and sub-symbolic AI, and investigating how symbolic
      AI can support the V&V process of sub-symbolic AI. These claims indicate new
      contributions in the field of neurosymbolic AI.'

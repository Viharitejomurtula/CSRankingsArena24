    evaluation_prompt: 'Disqualified: no evaluation. Reason: The paper lacks any form
      of empirical, experimental, or quantitative evaluation. It primarily consists
      of a literature review and conceptual discussion without presenting structured
      testing or evaluation results.'
    related_work_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The abstract and introduction both engage
      with prior research by mentioning a comprehensive review of 126 papers, discussing
      the evolution of Automated Planning and Scheduling (APS) and Large Language
      Models (LLMs), and referencing foundational works in AI and APS (e.g., Russell
      and Norvig 2003; Ghallab, Nau, and Traverso 2004). The paper also compares its
      findings with existing literature and identifies gaps, indicating meaningful
      engagement with prior work.'
    novelty_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper presents a comprehensive review
      of the integration of large language models (LLMs) in automated planning and
      scheduling (APS), identifying eight distinct categories of application. It highlights
      the novel insight that the integration of LLMs with traditional symbolic planners
      can lead to a promising neuro-symbolic approach, which combines the generative
      capabilities of LLMs with the precision of classical planning methods. This
      represents a novel direction in the field, advocating for leveraging the complementary
      strengths of LLMs and symbolic planners to develop more advanced planning systems.'
    review_only_prompt: 'Disqualified: review paper. Reason: The title contains the
      word "survey," and the main body primarily summarizes existing work across eight
      categories of LLM applications in APS without introducing new methods, datasets,
      experiments, or frameworks.'

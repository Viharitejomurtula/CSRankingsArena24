      mapping study that aims to categorize and list existing methods, techniques,
      and tools in the field of Automated Test Production (ATP). It does not propose
      any new methods, algorithms, architectures, datasets, or insights, nor does
      it apply known techniques in a novel context or domain. The paper primarily
      focuses on summarizing and categorizing existing literature without making any
      claims of novel contributions.'
    review_only_prompt: 'Disqualified: review paper. Reason: The paper''s title contains

    \ Processing Techniques in Requirements Engineering"
  id: ''
  decisions:
    language: '- Qualified. Reason: English Paper'
    evaluation_prompt: 'Disqualified: no evaluation. Reason: The paper provides guidelines
      and discussions on NLP techniques in requirements engineering but lacks any
      empirical, experimental, or quantitative evaluation. There are no sections or
      evidence of structured evaluation, such as experiments, results, or performance
      measurements.'
    related_work_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The introduction mentions prior research
      and work by referencing various requirements automation problems they have studied,
      such as checking compliance with requirements templates, glossary construction,
      model extraction, requirements demarcation, ambiguity handling, and question
      answering. Additionally, the abstract discusses the comparison of different
      NLP strategies, indicating engagement with existing methods and approaches.'
    novelty_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper presents practical guidelines for
      selecting and evaluating NLP techniques in the context of Requirements Engineering
      (RE), which is a novel application of known NLP methods. The paper also claims
      to offer insights based on the authors'' research experiences, which could be
      considered a new contribution to the field. Additionally, the paper discusses
      the decision process for selecting analysis techniques, which adds a structured
      approach to the application of NLP in RE.'
    review_only_prompt: 'Disqualified: review paper. Reason: The title contains the
      word "Guidelines," which suggests a survey or review nature, and the main body
      primarily summarizes existing NLP techniques and methods in the context of requirements
      engineering without introducing new methods, datasets, experiments, or frameworks.'

  id: ''
  decisions:
    language: '- Qualified. Reason: English Paper'
    evaluation_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper contains sections dedicated to
      "Qualitative Analysis" and "Analysis of Results," which include figures and
      tables presenting quantifiable outcomes of the studies reviewed. It discusses
      the types of studies or evaluations conducted, such as models, methods, processes,
      techniques, and tools used in Automated Test Production, providing structured
      evaluation and empirical analysis.'
    related_work_prompt: '- Qualified. Reason: The abstract mentions a "previously
      produced Systematic Literature Mapping (SLM)" which indicates engagement with
      prior research to formulate research questions and parameters for the current
      review.'
    novelty_prompt: '- Disqualified: no novelty. Reason: The paper is a systematic
      literature review that aims to provide an overview of existing models, methodologies,
      and tools related to Automated Test Production. It does not propose any new
      methods, algorithms, architectures, datasets, or insights, nor does it apply
      known techniques in a novel context or domain. The paper focuses on summarizing
      and categorizing existing research rather than contributing new ideas or results.'

- title: Automated Test Production -- Complement to "Ad-hoc" Testing
  id: ''
  decisions:
    language: '- Qualified. Reason: English Paper'
    evaluation_prompt: 'Disqualified: no evaluation. Reason: The paper lacks any form
      of empirical, experimental, or quantitative evaluation. It contains only design
      discussions, conceptual proposals, and subjective reflections without any structured
      or reproducible testing or evaluation.'
    related_work_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The abstract and introduction of the
      paper engage with prior research by referencing the Agile Manifesto and discussing
      its impact on industry trends. The introduction also cites several sources,
      indicating engagement with existing literature and practices related to agile
      software development and continuous integration.'
    novelty_prompt: 'Disqualified: no novelty. Reason: The paper provides a comprehensive
      review of existing software testing methods, both formal and empirical, and
      discusses the challenges and gaps between industry practices and academic advances.
      However, it does not propose any new methods, algorithms, architectures, datasets,
      or insights, nor does it apply known techniques in a novel context or domain.
      The paper primarily summarizes existing knowledge and discusses the state of
      the field without making clear claims of novel contributions.'

- title: What Is an App Store? The Software Engineering Perspective
  id: ''
  decisions:
    language: '- Qualified. Reason: English Paper'
    evaluation_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The abstract mentions that the authors
      collected a set of app store examples from web search queries, analyzed and
      curated the results, derived a set of features, built a dimensional model, and
      performed unsupervised clustering to find natural groupings of app stores. These
      activities indicate a structured evaluation involving data collection, analysis,
      and modeling.'
    related_work_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper''s introduction references
      prior research, such as studies by Harman et al. on BlackBerry App World and
      Lin et al. on game reviews in mobile app stores versus the Steam platform. It
      also discusses the historical context of app stores, mentioning platforms like
      Google Play, Apple''s App Store, and others, indicating engagement with existing
      literature and prior work in the field.'
    novelty_prompt: '- Qualified. Reason: The paper claims novelty by proposing a
      dimensional model of app stores, which is a new approach to understanding the
      broader diversity and impact of app stores beyond just mobile platforms. The
      abstract and introduction indicate that the research aims to provide a more
      holistic view of app stores, which has not been extensively covered in previous
      research.'
    review_only_prompt: 'Disqualified: review paper. Reason: The paper''s title contains
      the word "survey," and the main body primarily summarizes existing work on app
      stores without introducing new methods, datasets, experiments, or frameworks.
      The paper aims to survey and characterize app stores and explore their influence
      on software development practices, but it does not propose any novel contributions.'

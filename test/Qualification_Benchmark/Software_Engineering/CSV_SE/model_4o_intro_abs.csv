"T-FREX: A Transformer-based Feature Extraction Method from Mobile App
  Reviews",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03833v1,"Qualified. Reason: The abstract mentions an empirical evaluation of the T-FREX method, including the assessment of its performance against a ground truth dataset and a comparison with a baseline method. Additionally, there is mention of an external human evaluation of the predicted features, indicating structured evaluation.","- Qualified. Reason: The abstract and introduction contain multiple references to prior work, including citations of traditional methods for feature extraction, challenges with existing approaches, and the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software-related tasks. The paper compares its approach, T-FREX, with a baseline method and discusses the limitations of previous techniques, demonstrating engagement with prior research.","Qualified. Reason: The paper introduces T-FREX, a novel Transformer-based approach for feature extraction from mobile app reviews, which is a clear claim of novelty. The abstract and introduction explicitly state the proposal of a new method and outline the contributions, including redefining the app feature extraction problem as a named entity recognition task and providing a reusable fine-tuned model and dataset.","- Qualified. Reason: The paper introduces T-FREX, a novel Transformer-based approach for feature extraction from mobile app reviews. It proposes a new method, conducts experiments, and claims contributions such as a reusable fine-tuned model and a ground-truth dataset, indicating new contributions beyond a survey or review."
What Is an App Store? The Software Engineering Perspective,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04287v1,"- Qualified. Reason: The abstract mentions that the authors collected app store examples, analyzed and curated the results, derived a set of features, built a dimensional model, and performed unsupervised clustering to find natural groupings of app stores. These activities suggest empirical and structured evaluation methods were used in the study.","Qualified. Reason: The abstract and introduction of the paper mention prior research and engage with it. Specifically, the introduction references previous studies by Harman et al. and Lin et al., discussing their focus and findings related to app stores. This indicates that the paper builds upon and compares its work with existing research.",Qualified. Reason: The paper claims novelty by proposing a dimensional model of app stores and aims to provide a holistic view of app stores beyond just mobile platforms. It explicitly states its contribution by aiming to create a more general model of app stores and exploring how app store-centric design can affect software development practices.,"- Disqualified: review paper. Reason: The paper's title and abstract indicate that it is a survey of app stores, aiming to characterize their broader dimensionality and explore their influence on software development practices. The abstract and introduction do not propose any new methods, results, or tools, but rather focus on summarizing existing work and providing a holistic view of app stores."
"Which Syntactic Capabilities Are Statistically Learned by Masked
  Language Models for Code?",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01512v2,"- Qualified. Reason: The abstract and introduction mention conducting a case study on two popular MLMs using data from GitHub repositories, measuring causal effects, and using SyntaxEval to evaluate performance. This indicates structured evaluation through empirical and quantitative methods.","- Qualified. Reason: The abstract and introduction contain multiple references to prior research, including citations of previous studies on large language models, code completion, and the use of Masked Language Models (MLMs). The paper discusses existing approaches and findings, compares its goals with current research, and references prior methods and datasets, indicating engagement with prior work.","Qualified. Reason: The paper introduces a new technique called SyntaxEval to enhance the evaluation of Masked Language Models (MLMs) in code completion tasks by leveraging syntactic capabilities. The paper explicitly states its contributions, including the introduction of this new evaluation approach and a case study that uses causal analysis to understand the influence of different AST node types on code completion.","- Qualified. Reason: The paper introduces a new technique called SyntaxEval for evaluating Masked Language Models (MLMs) in code completion tasks, conducts a case study, and presents experimental results. These elements indicate that the paper proposes new contributions rather than merely summarizing existing work."

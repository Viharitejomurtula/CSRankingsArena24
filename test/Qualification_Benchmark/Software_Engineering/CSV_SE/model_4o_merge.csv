Reason: The paper proposes a new method called SliceLocator for identifying fine-grained information from vulnerable code using GNN-based vulnerability detectors. It describes the development and evaluation of this novel approach, highlighting its effectiveness compared to existing methods. The paper includes claims of novelty and contributions, such as the introduction of a new technique and its performance evaluation, which disqualifies it as a survey or review paper."
"T-FREX: A Transformer-based Feature Extraction Method from Mobile App
  Reviews",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03833v1,"Qualified. Reason: The abstract and introduction mention an empirical evaluation of the T-FREX method, including the use of a dataset for fine-tuning models, performance assessment against a ground truth, comparison with a baseline method, and external human evaluation of predicted features.","Qualified. Reason: The abstract and introduction contain multiple references to prior work, including citations of traditional methods for feature extraction, challenges with existing approaches, and the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software-related tasks. The paper also compares its proposed method, T-FREX, with a baseline method from the field, demonstrating engagement with existing research.","Qualified. Reason: The paper claims novelty by proposing T-FREX, a new Transformer-based approach for feature extraction from mobile app reviews. The introduction explicitly states that this is a novel approach and outlines the contributions, including redefining the app feature extraction problem as a named entity recognition task and providing a reusable fine-tuned model and dataset.","- Qualified. Reason: The paper introduces T-FREX, a novel Transformer-based approach for feature extraction from mobile app reviews. It proposes a new method, evaluates its performance, and provides a reusable model and dataset, indicating new contributions beyond a mere survey or review."
What Is an App Store? The Software Engineering Perspective,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04287v1,"Qualified. Reason: The abstract mentions that the authors collected a set of app store examples from web search queries, analyzed and curated the results, derived a set of features, built a dimensional model, and performed unsupervised clustering to find natural groupings of app stores. These activities indicate a structured evaluation involving data collection, analysis, and modeling.","Qualified. Reason: The paper's introduction references prior research, such as studies by Harman et al. on BlackBerry App World and Lin et al. on game reviews in mobile app stores versus the Steam platform. It also discusses the historical context of app stores, mentioning platforms like Google Play, Apple's App Store, and others, indicating engagement with existing literature and prior work in the field.","- Qualified. Reason: The paper claims novelty by proposing a dimensional model of app stores, which is a new approach to understanding the broader diversity and impact of app stores beyond just mobile platforms. The abstract and introduction indicate that the research aims to provide a more holistic view of app stores, which has not been extensively covered in previous research.","Disqualified: review paper. Reason: The paper's title contains the word ""survey,"" and the main body primarily summarizes existing work on app stores without introducing new methods, datasets, experiments, or frameworks. The paper aims to survey and characterize app stores and explore their influence on software development practices, but it does not propose any novel contributions."
"Which Syntactic Capabilities Are Statistically Learned by Masked
  Language Models for Code?",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01512v2,"Qualified. Reason: The abstract and introduction mention a case study conducted on two popular MLMs using data from GitHub repositories, and the use of SyntaxEval to measure causal effects on code completion performance. Additionally, the paper references experimental data, curated datasets, and statistical analysis, indicating structured evaluation.","- Qualified. Reason: The abstract and introduction contain multiple references to prior research, including citations of previous studies on code completion, machine learning approaches, and the use of Masked Language Models (MLMs). The paper discusses its contributions in the context of existing work and aims to address gaps identified in prior research.","Qualified. Reason: The paper introduces a new technique called SyntaxEval to enhance the evaluation of Masked Language Models (MLMs) in code completion tasks by leveraging syntactic capabilities. The paper explicitly states its contributions, including the introduction of this novel evaluation approach and a case study using causal analysis.","- Qualified. Reason: The paper introduces a new technique called SyntaxEval for evaluating Masked Language Models (MLMs) in code completion tasks, conducts a case study, and presents experimental results. These elements indicate that the paper proposes new methods and contributions rather than solely summarizing existing work."

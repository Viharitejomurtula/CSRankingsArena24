- title: Automated Test Production -- Systematic Literature Mapping
  id: ''
  decisions:
    language: '- Qualified. Reason: English Paper'
    evaluation_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper includes structured evaluation
      through systematic literature mapping, detailing search criteria, inclusion/exclusion
      criteria, and categorization of studies, which demonstrates empirical analysis
      of the topic.'
    related_work_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper contains a comprehensive "Literature
      Systematic Mapping" section that discusses prior research, includes meaningful
      citations to academic papers, and explains how the work builds upon previous
      studies in the field of Automated Test Production.'
    novelty_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper presents a systematic literature
      mapping (SLM) of Automated Test Production (ATP), which identifies and categorizes
      existing methods, techniques, and tools in the field. It claims contributions
      such as identifying open questions, tracking research progress, and proposing
      a structured approach to classify studies, demonstrating novelty in its methodology
      and insights.'
    review_only_prompt: 'Disqualified: review paper. Reason: The title contains the
      word "mapping" which indicates a systematic literature mapping, and the main
      body primarily summarizes existing work without introducing new methods, datasets,
      experiments, or frameworks.'

- title: What Is an App Store? The Software Engineering Perspective
  id: ''
  decisions:
    language: '- Qualified. Reason: English Paper'
    evaluation_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The abstract mentions performing unsupervised
      clustering on app stores to find their natural groupings, indicating an empirical
      evaluation approach. Additionally, the introduction discusses the aim to survey
      and characterize app stores, which implies structured evaluation of their properties
      and impacts on software development practices.'
    related_work_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper references prior research,
      including studies by Harman et al. and Lin et al., and discusses how their findings
      relate to the current work, indicating engagement with existing literature on
      app stores.'
    novelty_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper claims novelty by proposing a holistic
      approach to studying app stores, aiming to create a more general model that
      encompasses both mobile and non-mobile variants, which is a new contribution
      to the existing research landscape.'
    review_only_prompt: 'Disqualified: review paper. Reason: The title contains the
      word "survey" and the main body primarily summarizes existing work without introducing

    language: '- Qualified. Reason: English Paper'
    evaluation_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The introduction mentions the development
      of a polynomial time algorithm that models the behavior of a decision tree and
      discusses the accuracy of this algorithm, including a comparison of the depth
      of the decision tree described by it and the minimum depth of a decision tree.
      Additionally, it states plans for future computer experiments to explore the
      hypothesis regarding the performance of the algorithms, indicating empirical
      evaluation.'
    related_work_prompt: '- Qualified. Reason: The paper includes multiple academic
      citations and references to prior work, discusses the relationship between decision
      trees and decision rule systems, and compares its approach to existing methods
      and findings in the field.'
    novelty_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper proposes a new polynomial time algorithm
      that models the behavior of a decision tree for a given tuple of attribute values,
      which is a clear claim of novelty in the abstract and introduction.'
    review_only_prompt: 'Qualified. Reason: The paper proposes a new polynomial time
      algorithm that models the behavior of decision trees, indicating that it presents
      new methods and contributions rather than merely summarizing existing work.'

    Automated Planning and Scheduling is among the growing areas in Artificial

    Intelligence (AI) where mention of LLMs has gained popularity. Based on a

    comprehensive review of 126 papers, this paper investigates eight categories

    based on the unique applications of LLMs in addressing various aspects of

    planning problems: language translation, plan generation, model construction,

    multi-agent planning, interactive planning, heuristics optimization, tool

    integration, and brain-inspired planning. For each category, we articulate the

    issues considered and existing gaps. A critical insight resulting from our

    review is that the true potential of LLMs unfolds when they are integrated with

    traditional symbolic planners, pointing towards a promising neuro-symbolic

    approach. This approach effectively combines the generative aspects of LLMs

    with the precision of classical planning methods. By synthesizing insights from

    existing literature, we underline the potential of this integration to address

    complex planning challenges. Our goal is to encourage the ICAPS community to

    recognize the complementary strengths of LLMs and symbolic planners, advocating

    for a direction in automated planning that leverages these synergistic

    capabilities to develop more advanced and intelligent planning systems.


    ## Introduction

    As a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence (Russell and Norvig 2003), Automated
    Planning and Scheduling (Ghallab, Nau, and Traverso 2004) refers to developing
    algorithms and systems to generate plans or sequences of actions to achieve specific
    goals in a given environment or problem domain. APS is a valuable tool in domains
    where there is a need for intelligent decision-making, goal achievement, and efficient
    resource utilization. It enables the automation of complex tasks, making systems
    more capable and adaptable in dynamic environments. Over time, APS has evolved
    from the early development of robust theoretical foundations to practical applications
    in diverse sectors like manufacturing, space exploration, and personal scheduling.
    This evolution underscores the versatility and critical significance of APS.


    In parallel with advancements in APS, the development and proliferation of LLMs
    have marked a substantial leap in AI, particularly within computational linguistics.
    Evolving from early efforts in natural language processing (NLP), LLMs have undergone
    significant transformation. Initially focused on basic tasks like word prediction
    and syntax analysis, newer models are characterized by their ability to generate
    coherent, contextually relevant text and perform diverse, complex linguistic tasks.
    Trained on extensive text corpora, LLMs have mastered human-like language patterns.
    Their recent success in various NLP tasks has prompted efforts to apply these
    models in APS. There is a notable shift towards using language constructs to specify
    aspects of planning, such as preconditions, effects, and goals, rather than relying
    solely on traditional planning domain languages like PDDL.


    This paper presents an exhaustive literature review exploring the integration
    of LLMs in APS across eight categories: Language Translation, Plan Generation,
    Model Construction, Multi-agent Planning, Interactive Planning, Heuristics Optimization,
    Brain-Inspired Planning, and Tool Integration. Table 1 provides the description
    for the eight categories. Our comprehensive analysis of 126 papers not only categorizes
    LLMs'' diverse contributions but also identifies significant gaps in each domain.

    these models have posed significant challenges, including substantial computing

    power, memory consumption, bandwidth demands, etc. Therefore, employing

    efficient training and serving strategies becomes particularly crucial. Many

    researchers have actively explored and proposed effective methods. So, a

    comprehensive survey of them is essential for system developers and

    researchers. This paper extensively explores the methods employed in training

    and serving foundation models from various perspectives. It provides a detailed

    categorization of these state-of-the-art methods, including finer aspects such

    as network, computing, and storage. Additionally, the paper summarizes the

    challenges and presents a perspective on the future development direction of

    foundation model systems. Through comprehensive discussion and analysis, it

    research and applications, promoting continuous innovation and development in

    foundation model systems.


    ## Introduction

    T He combination of deep learning techniques and powerful computational capabilities
    continuously drives the development of artificial general intelligence, ushering
    us into the era of foundation models. However, achieving successful applications
    of foundation models is inseparable from comprehensive support at the system level.
    A foundation model system is built upon extensive training data, state-ofthe-art
    models, high-performance computing resources, and meticulously optimized training
    and serving algorithms. The primary purpose of this system is to handle complex
    tasks with heightened precision, such as GPT3 [\[1\]](#page-10-0), LLaMA [\[2\]](#page-10-1),
    PanGu-Σ [\[3\]](#page-10-2), PengCheng Mind [\[4\]](#page-10-3) etc.


    Foundation models have demonstrated extraordinary performance in many tasks. This
    has led more and more major technology giants to dedicate significant human and
    financial resources to actively develop their foundation model systems, which
    increases the parameter size (Figure [1\)](#page-1-0). However, as the parameter
    size of foundational model systems continues to grow, challenges are posed throughout
    the lifecycle of foundation models, particularly during the training and serving
    phases. In the training phase, the substantial parameter size results in significant
    demands for computation and storage, creating immense pressure on hardware resources
    and computational efficiency. Consequently, training these models usually takes
    a long time and requires efficient utilization of computational resources. In
    the serving phase, with the widespread application of foundation models, the significant
    increase in workload has become an unavoidable challenge. This heightened demand
    may lead to issues for serving systems, such as latency, performance decline,
    or resource bottlenecks. Therefore, employing highly efficient

    Time.**

    training and serving strategies becomes particularly crucial. Many researchers
    have actively explored and proposed effective methods for training and serving.
    However, different approaches have different application scenarios. So, it poses
    a challenge for system developers who struggle to identify the most suitable method
    for their problems. This challenge is precisely why this paper was proposed.


    Although there have been some surveys on foundation models, Most surveys [\[5\]](#page-10-4)–[\[11\]](#page-10-5)
    predominantly focus on model design and downstream task adaptation, with only
    a minority delving into foundation model training. However, there are two notable
    shortcomings in these training-centric surveys [\[12\]](#page-10-6): firstly,
    they lack in-depth exploration from the perspective of updates in network, computing,
    and storage; secondly, their primary emphasis is on the training phase, neglecting
    considerations for the serving phase. Therefore, a comprehensive survey of foundation
    model training and serving methods is essential for system developers and researchers.
    Accordingly, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art
    methods in this domain. This paper provides systems developers and researchers
    valuable information through comprehensive analysis and comparison. It assists
    them in making the right decisions when confronted with the challenges associated

    Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging branch of AI that

    combines the strengths of symbolic AI and sub-symbolic AI. A major drawback of

    sub-symbolic AI is that it acts as a "black box", meaning that predictions are

    difficult to explain, making the testing & evaluation (T&E) and validation &

    verification (V&V) processes of a system that uses sub-symbolic AI a challenge.

    Since neurosymbolic AI combines the advantages of both symbolic and

    sub-symbolic AI, this survey explores how neurosymbolic applications can ease

    the V&V process. This survey considers two taxonomies of neurosymbolic AI,

    evaluates them, and analyzes which algorithms are commonly used as the symbolic

    and sub-symbolic components in current applications. Additionally, an overview

    of current techniques for the T&E and V&V processes of these components is

    provided. Furthermore, it is investigated how the symbolic part is used for T&E

    and V&V purposes in current neurosymbolic applications. Our research shows that

    neurosymbolic AI as great potential to ease the T&E and V&V processes of

    sub-symbolic AI by leveraging the possibilities of symbolic AI. Additionally,

    the applicability of current T&E and V&V methods to neurosymbolic AI is

    assessed, and how different neurosymbolic architectures can impact these

    methods is explored. It is found that current T&E and V&V techniques are partly

    sufficient to test, evaluate, verify, or validate the symbolic and sub-symbolic

    part of neurosymbolic applications independently, while some of them use

    approaches where current T&E and V&V methods are not applicable by default, and

    adjustments or even new approaches are needed. Our research shows that there is

    great potential in using symbolic AI to test, evaluate, verify, or validate the

    predictions of a sub-symbolic model, making neurosymbolic AI an interesting

    research direction for safe, secure, and trustworthy AI.


    ## Introduction

    N EUROSYMBOLIC artificial intelligence (AI) is an increasingly important trend
    in machine learning (ML) and has been referred to as the 3rd wave of artificial
    intelligence [\[1\]](#page-11-0). The word "neuro" in its name implies the use
    of neural networks, especially deep learning (DL), which is sometimes also referred
    to as sub-symbolic AI. This technique is known for its powerful learning and abstraction
    ability, allowing models to find underlying patterns in large datasets or learn
    complex behaviors [\[2\]](#page-11-1). On the other hand, "symbolic" refers to
    symbolic AI. It is based on the idea that intelligence can be represented using
    symbols like rules based on logic or other representations of knowledge [\[3\]](#page-11-2).
    Neurosymbolic AI combines these two approaches to create a hybrid system that
    benefits from the reasoning abilities of symbolic AI and the adaptability of sub-symbolic
    AI, opening new opportunities to improve a variety of different AI branches [\[4\]](#page-11-3),
    [\[5\]](#page-11-4).


    A disadvantage of sub-symbolic AI is its nature of being a "black box". This means
    that predictions made by these systems can be challenging to explain. Therefore,
    when an edge case leads to a system failure, it is often hard to find the reason
    for it. Accordingly, the rigorous testing & evaluation (T&E) and validation &
    verification (V&V) of these "black box" is a relevant topic recognized by governments
    [\[6\]](#page-11-5) and discussed in current literature [\[7\]](#page-11-6), [\[8\]](#page-11-7).
    As neurosymbolic systems incorporate a sub-symbolic component, this work aims
    to provide an overview of current techniques used to validate and verify the symbolic
    as well as sub-symbolic component, and how the architecture of neurosymbolic systems
    affects this process and can be used for V&V purposes.


    In software engineering, common terms are testing & evaluation or T&E and verification
    & validation or V&V. As defined by Wallace and Fujii in [\[9\]](#page-12-0), V&V
    intends to ensure that software performs as intended and meets certain quality
    and reliability standards. T&E are the methods and processes used to carry out
    V&V. Validation refers to the process of ensuring that a system performs as expected
    and delivers the desired result with sufficient accuracy, while verification focuses
    on checking if the design and implementation is correct according to the specified
    requirements [\[10\]](#page-12-1). Usually, verification is a process that takes
    place during development, while validation occurs at the end to evaluate if the
    program "does what it''s supposed to do" [\[11\]](#page-12-2). For reasons of
    readability, we primarily use the term V&V in the following.


    Recent frameworks propose methods to validate and verify symbolic and sub-symbolic
    AI, but discussing how the architecture of neurosymbolic AI can benefit the V&V
    process of the system as a whole has not received enough attention yet. Therefore,
    this paper focuses on two areas. First, the concept of V&V is mapped to symbolic
    and sub-symbolic AI, and an overview of current techniques and procedures used
    during the V&V process is provided. Secondly, it assesses how different neurosymbolic
    applications use the symbolic side to enable V&V of the sub-symbolic component.
    For this purpose, two different taxonomies of neurosymbolic AI are addressed,
    which categorize applications based on their architecture. 1) In 2020, Kautz proposed
    six possible designs of neurosymbolic systems [\[12\]](#page-12-3). 2) An alternative
    taxonomy was introduced by Yu et al. [\[13\]](#page-12-4) in 2021. These taxonomies
    are discussed and compared. Based on this, it is analyzed how current neurosymbolic
    applications leverage these architectures to use the symbolic component to make
    the sub-symbolic part more transparent, accurate, or safe, therefore enabling
    the V&V process through a neurosymbolic system design. The structure of the discussion
    within this paper is visualized in Fig. [1.](#page-2-0)


    Our work demonstrates that some of the current testing methods used for V&V are
    applicable to neurosymbolic AI. In particular, the combination of knowledge graphs
    (KGs) and DL is common, and it would be interesting to design a dedicated testing
    framework based on current techniques to validate neurosymbolic AI as a whole.
    However, there are also neurosymbolic AI applications that are not easy to test
    with current means. With this work, we show that there is much research potential
    in this area, and advocate the awareness of V&V for neurosymbolic AI systems and
    AI in general. Overall, this paper makes the following contributions:


    - Present and compare two current taxonomies of neurosymbolic AI.

    - Map the concepts of V&V as used in software engineer-

    ing to symbolic and sub-symbolic AI.


    - Survey current V&V approaches for symbolic and subsymbolic AI.

    - Analyze the applicability of current V&V methods to neurosymbolic applications.

    - Investigate how symbolic AI can support the V&V process of sub-symbolic AI within
    a neurosymbolic system.

    - Discuss opportunities and challenges of V&V in the domain of neurosymbolic AI.


    The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In section [II](#page-2-1)
    we analyze the related work. After that, in section [III](#page-3-0) we examine
    and compare two different taxonomies for neurosymbolic AI. Then, in section [IV](#page-5-0)
    and [V](#page-6-0) we survey the most important methods to verify and validate
    symbolic AI and sub-symbolic AI respectively. In section [VI](#page-8-0) we analyze
    if these methods are applicable to current neurosymbolic AI applications and opportunities
    to leverage different neurosymbolic architectures using the symbolic part to verify
    and validate sub-symbolic AI. Afterward, in section [VII](#page-10-0) we explain
    research gaps and problems that might be worth exploring in further research.
    In section [VIII](#page-11-8) we summarize our findings and explain our planned
    future work.'

    Chatbots are conversational software applications designed to interact

    dialectically with users for a plethora of different purposes. Surprisingly,

    these colloquial agents have only recently been coupled with computational

    models of arguments (i.e. computational argumentation), whose aim is to

    formalise, in a machine-readable format, the ordinary exchange of information

    that characterises human communications. Chatbots may employ argumentation with

    different degrees and in a variety of manners. The present survey sifts through

    the literature to review papers concerning this kind of argumentation-based

    bot, drawing conclusions about the benefits and drawbacks that this approach

    entails in comparison with standard chatbots, while also envisaging possible

    future development and integration with the Transformer-based architecture and

    state-of-the-art Large Language models.


    ## Introduction

    Chatbots are conversational software applications designed to mimic human discourse
    mostly to enable automated online guidance and support (Caldarini et al., 2022).
    These computer programs generate responses based on given inputs, producing replies
    via text or speech format (Sojasingarayar, 2020; Bala et al., 2017). In addition,
    to be defined as such, chatbots must satisfy specific functions. As colloquial
    agents, they need to be able to understand the user (comprehension), have access
    to a knowledge base (competence) and provide an ''anthropomorphic effect'' to
    increase the users'' trust (presence) (Cahn, 2017; Sansonnet et al., 2006). Nowadays,
    these bots represent familiar tools that exist in our lives in the form of virtual
    agents. Their assistance ranges from answering inquiries to e-commerce, from information
    retrieval to educational tasks, and from developing new industrial solutions (Dale,
    2016) to connecting smart objects (Kar & Haldar, 2016). The manifold investments
    of the past decade, the technological advancements (from both software and hardware
    viewpoints), and the development of more efficient Machine Learning (ML) models,
    including the latest Transformer-based architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), have
    contributed to the steady growth of the research field of chatbot design and implementation.
    Many steps forward have been taken since the release of ELIZA around sixty years
    ago, which is widely considered to be the first conversational agent (Weizenbaum,
    1966).


    The investigation of computational models of arguments in relation to chatbots
    has only recently received attention from researchers. Computational argumentation
    (Rahwan & Simari, 2009) has been applied in Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a
    mechanism for reasoning in which conclusions are drawn from evidence that supports
    the conclusions. Being an intuitive (i.e. closer to everyday human dialectical
    interplay), yet formal, approach for modelling conflicting information occurring
    during exchange of arguments, computational argumentation should be qualified
    as a highly appropriate methodology to enhance current bot behaviours. The benefits
    from such a combination include: more natural discourse, response coherence and
    strategical conveyance of information. Evaluating argumentation semantics would
    also provide the rationale for positing replies in a more transparent way than
    the black-box Large Language models (LLMs) employed in today''s state-of-the-art
    conversational agents. In recent years, cutting-edge technologies have produced
    implementations, such as the various versions of ChatGPT<sup>1</sup> , which currently
    outperform argumentation-based conversational agents. Nonetheless, taking a closer
    look—as we do here—shows that there is plenty of room for improvement for these
    recent advanced models, and integration with the computational argumentation formalism
    may solve their present shortcomings (e.g. lack of explainability), thus potentially
    initiating a new generation of chatbots. To the best of our knowledge, this is

    The article identified 42 cognitive architectures for creating general

    artificial intelligence (AGI) and proposed a set of interrelated functional

    blocks that an agent approaching AGI in its capabilities should possess. Since

    the required set of blocks is not found in any of the existing architectures,

    the article proposes a new cognitive architecture for intelligent systems

    approaching AGI in their capabilities. As one of the key solutions within the

    framework of the architecture, a universal method of knowledge representation

    is proposed, which allows combining various non-formalized, partially and fully

    formalized methods of knowledge representation in a single knowledge base, such

    as texts in natural languages, images, audio and video recordings, graphs,

    algorithms, databases, neural networks, knowledge graphs, ontologies, frames,

    essence-property-relation models, production systems, predicate calculus

    models, conceptual models, and others. To combine and structure various

    fragments of knowledge, archigraph models are used, constructed as a

    development of annotated metagraphs. As components, the cognitive architecture

    being developed includes machine consciousness, machine subconsciousness,

    blocks of interaction with the external environment, a goal management block,

    an emotional control system, a block of social interaction, a block of

    reflection, an ethics block and a worldview block, a learning block, a

    monitoring block, blocks of statement and solving problems, self-organization

    and meta learning block.


    ## Introduction

    In recent years, there has been a rapid and multidirectional development of intelligent
    information systems developed by people [1]. In [2], it was assumed that a relatively
    distant extrapolation of the functionality of these developments would be the
    creation of a general artificial intelligence comparable to human intelligence
    (in current terminology – AGI). The main capabilities of an intelligent information
    system, such as perceptual abilities, attention mechanisms, choice of actions,
    learning, memory, reasoning and their practical application are determined by
    the cognitive architecture used in the system [3]. If we consider the basic principles
    of functioning, then cognitive architectures are the opposite of expert systems.
    Expert systems provide solutions to intellectual tasks in a narrowly defined context,
    in the segment of activity for which they have knowledge, in contrast, cognitive
    architectures aim to providing a wide coverage, solving a diverse set of tasks
    in different fields. More importantly, cognitive architectures provide intelligent
    behavior at the system level, rather than at the level of methods of individual
    components designed to solve specialized tasks [3].


    In 2016-18, after a relatively long break, two reviews of cognitive architectures
    were published [4, 5] (the third version of the publication [4], like the publication
    [5], appeared in 1918). After that, no systematic reviews were published until
    preparation of this article. Only brief reviews were published as part of the
    justification for the need to develop new architectures. In these two reviews,
    which cover about 140 architectures, we identified cognitive architectures designed
    to create AGI, and supplemented the list with the results of a bibliographic search.


    Unlike the reviews in [6,7], the authors of which considered cognitive architectures
    for creating AGI, including architectures that were not intended for this purpose
    in the review, we consider it important to analyze precisely cognitive architectures
    that are declared as architectures intended for creating AGI, since additional
    requirements are imposed on them [8]. Other cognitive architectures could be developed
    to test some technical solutions or to solve more utilitarian tasks, for example,
    for image processing or controlling a transport robot transporting workpieces
    in the workshop.


    In the list of cognitive architectures, if the architecture does not have a name,
    it will be presented simply with a link to the publication. The final list of
    cognitive architectures for analysis includes 42 architectures, presented in Table
    1. For each architecture, this table contains citations indicating that the architecture
    is intended to enable AGI. For some architectures, publications do not explicitly
    mention AGI as a target. In these cases, the decision to include in the list is
    determined by the goals of the architecture to model human-like behavior or by
    focusing on the complex of functions inherent with humans.

    ## Introduction

    Human cognitive factors such as perception, attention, memory, language, reasoning,
    processing speed, and executive functions [1] have known limitations. [2][3][4][5]
    In contrast, Artificial intelligence (AI) systems transcend many boundaries of
    human cognition, particularly for memory, attention, and executive function. [6][7]
    Large language models such as GPT-4 already outperform humans in language areas
    such as lexical knowledge, grammatical sensitivity, communication ability, naming
    facility, and fluency. [\[1\]](#page-0-0)[8]


    Exploration of AI''s cognitive capabilities in the context of business process
    management (BPM) offers insights into knowledge-intensive processes that are predominantly
    driven by human activities. [9] Knowledge-intensive processes can only be partially
    mapped to a process model and commonly vary due to circumstances and administrative
    discretion. [10] Facilitation of these processes is within the domain of Cognitive
    BPM, which manages business processes using cognitive computing technologies.
    [11] We reference other researchers'' AI model, ProcessGPT, as a practical representation
    of a Cognitive BPM solution (Fig. 1). ProcessGPT is an AI model whose goal is
    to suggest the best next step in a process based on a Process Knowledge Graph
    and extensive supporting elements. [12] While ProcessGPT is capable of process
    augmentation, automation, and improvement, we highlight the challenges faced by
    employees with cognitive disabilities by considering how ProcessGPT can augment
    their experience.

    Decision trees and decision rule systems play important roles as classifiers,

    knowledge representation tools, and algorithms. They are easily interpretable

    models for data analysis, making them widely used and studied in computer

    science. Understanding the relationships between these two models is an

    important task in this field. There are well-known methods for converting

    decision trees into systems of decision rules. In this paper, we consider the

    inverse transformation problem, which is not so simple. Instead of constructing

    an entire decision tree, our study focuses on a greedy polynomial time

    algorithm that simulates the operation of a decision tree on a given tuple of

    attribute values.


    ## Introduction

    Decision trees [\[3,](#page-7-0) [4,](#page-7-1) [8,](#page-7-2) [31,](#page-9-0)
    [34,](#page-10-0) [40\]](#page-10-1) and systems of decision rules [\[6,](#page-7-3)
    [7,](#page-7-4) [11,](#page-8-0) [14,](#page-8-1) [33,](#page-10-2) [34,](#page-10-0)
    [35,](#page-10-3) [36\]](#page-10-4) are widely used as classifiers, knowledge
    representation tools, and algorithms. They are known for their interpretability
    in data analysis [\[10,](#page-8-2) [15,](#page-8-3) [23,](#page-9-1) [41\]](#page-10-5).


    Investigating the relationship between these two models is an important task in
    computer science. Converting decision trees into decision rule systems is a well-known
    and simple process [\[37,](#page-10-6) [38,](#page-10-7) [39\]](#page-10-8). This
    paper focuses on the inverse transformation problem, which is not trivial.


    The research related to this problem encompasses several directions:


    • Two-stage construction of decision trees. This approach involves building decision
    rules based on input data, followed by the construction of decision trees or decision
    structures (which are generalizations of decision trees) using the generated rules.
    The benefits of this two-stage construction method are explained in [\[1,](#page-7-5)
    [2,](#page-7-6) [17,](#page-8-4) [18,](#page-8-5) [19,](#page-8-6) [20,](#page-9-2)
    [21,](#page-9-3) [22,](#page-9-4) [42\]](#page-10-9).


    - Relationships between the depth of deterministic and nondeterministic decision
    trees for computing Boolean functions [\[5,](#page-7-7) [16,](#page-8-7) [24,](#page-9-5)
    [43\]](#page-10-10). Note that the nondeterministic decision trees can be interpreted
    as decision rule systems. Note also that the minimum depth of a nondeterministic
    decision tree for a Boolean function is equal to its certificate complexity [\[9\]](#page-8-8).

    - Relationships between the depth of deterministic and nondeterministic decision
    trees for problems over finite and infinite information systems [\[25,](#page-9-6)
    [27,](#page-9-7) [29,](#page-9-8) [30,](#page-9-9) [32\]](#page-10-11). These
    systems consist of a universe and a set of attributes defined on it [\[35\]](#page-10-3).


    This paper builds upon the syntactic approach proposed in previous works [\[26,](#page-9-10)
    [28\]](#page-9-11). The approach assumes that we have a system of decision rules
    but lack knowledge of the input data, and our objective is to transform these
    rules into a decision tree.


    Let us consider a system of decision rules S, which consists of rules of the form


    $$

    (a_{i_1} = \delta_1) \wedge \cdots \wedge (a_{i_m} = \delta_m) \rightarrow \sigma,

    $$


    where ai<sup>1</sup> , . . . , ai<sup>m</sup> represent attributes, δ1, . . .
    , δ<sup>m</sup> are the corresponding attribute values, and σ is the decision.


    The problem associated with this system is to determine, for a given input (a
    tuple of values of attributes included in S), all the realizable rules, i.e.,
    rules with a true left-hand side. It is important to note that any attribute in
    the input can take any value.


    The objective of this paper is to minimize the number of queries required to determine
    the attribute values. To achieve this, decision trees are explored as algorithms
    for solving the problem at hand.


    In our previous work [\[12\]](#page-8-9), we investigated the minimum depth of
    decision trees for the considered problem and established both upper and lower
    bounds. These bounds depend on three parameters of the decision rule system: the
    total number of distinct attributes, the maximum length of a decision rule, and
    the maximum number of attribute values. We demonstrated that there exist systems
    of decision rules where the minimum depth of the decision trees is significantly
    smaller than the total number of attributes in the rule system. This finding shows
    that decision trees are a reasonable choice for such systems of decision rules.


    In another study [\[13\]](#page-8-10), we examined the complexity of constructing
    decision trees and acyclic decision graphs that represent decision trees. We found
    that in many cases, the minimum number of nodes in decision trees can grow as
    a superpolynomial function depending on the size of the decision rule systems.
    To address this issue, we introduced two types of acyclic decision graphs as representations
    of decision trees. However, simultaneously minimizing the depth and the number
    of nodes in these graphs poses a challenging bi-criteria optimization problem.


    We left this problem for future research and pursued an alternative approach:
    instead of constructing the entire decision tree, we developed a polynomial time
    algorithm that models the behavior of the decision tree for a given tuple of attribute
    values. This algorithm is based on an auxiliary algorithm for the construction
    of a node cover for a hypergraph corresponding to a decision rule system: nodes
    of this hypergraph correspond to attributes and edges – to rules from the rule
    system. The auxiliary algorithm is not greedy: at each step, this algorithm adds
    to the cover being constructed all the attributes belonging to a rule that has
    not yet been covered.


    In this paper, we develop a new algorithm with polynomial time complexity, which
    models the behavior of a decision tree solving the considered problem for a given
    tuple of attribute values. The auxiliary algorithm for it is a standard greedy
    algorithm for the set cover problem. Therefore we talk about the entire algorithm
    for describing the operation of decision trees as greedy. We study the accuracy
    of this algorithm, i.e., we compare the depth of the decision tree described by
    it and the minimum depth of a decision tree. The obtained bound is a bit worse
    in the comparison with the bound for the algorithm considered in [\[13\]](#page-8-10).
    However, we expect that the considered algorithms are mutually complementary:
    the old one will work better for systems with short decision rules and the new
    one will work better for systems with long decision rules. In the future, we are
    planning to do computer experiments to explore this hypothesis.


    In this paper, we repeat the main definitions from [\[12\]](#page-8-9) and give
    some lemmas from [\[12\]](#page-8-9) without proofs.


    This paper consists of five sections. Section [2](#page-2-0) considers the main
    definitions and notation. Section [3](#page-4-0) contains auxiliary statements.
    Section [4](#page-5-0) discusses the greedy algorithm, which models the behavior
    of a decision tree. Section [5](#page-6-0) contains short conclusions.'

    A view on software testing, taken in a broad sense and considered a important

    activity is presented. We discuss the methods and techniques for applying tests

    and the reasons we recognize make it difficult for industry to adopt the

    advances observed in academia. We discuss some advances in the area and briefly

    point out the approach we intend to follow in the search for a solution.


    ## Introduction

    Accepting that tests are important, but are not always implemented or kept up
    to date during the lifetime of a program, we conclude that nothing has changed
    since the introduction of the Agile Manifesto earlier this century [\[1\]](#page-13-0)
    which we reproduce below and from which we highlight the passage "Software that
    works rather than complete documentation"[\[1\]](#page-13-0).


    - "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"

    - "Working software over comprehensive documentation"

    - "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"

    - "Responding to change over following a plan"


    This view has come to become an important industry trend [\[2\]](#page-13-1)[1](#page-0-0)
    , where face-to-face interactions are preferable to formal communication processes
    and working programs are preferable to comprehensive documentation, leaving the
    interpretation of the term "comprehensive" to each agile development team to decide
    [\[4](#page-13-2)]. In fact the agile method suggests that all documentation can
    be replaced by informal communication with an emphasis on tacit rather than explicit
    knowledge [\[5\]](#page-14-0).


    <span id="page-0-0"></span><sup>1</sup>The 14<sup>o</sup> annual report STATEofAGILE
    from 2020 points out that 95% of organizations practice agile software development
    methods. [\[3](#page-13-3)].


    On the other hand, the adoption of continuous integration and continuous delivery
    processes and tools has been steadily and unequivocally growing in both industry
    [\[6](#page-14-1), [7](#page-14-2)] and open source projects [\[8\]](#page-14-3),
    which can to some extent be interpreted as a denial of one of the principles of
    the Agile Manifesto: "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools",
    yet this does not come as a relief to the fact that many see benefits in building
    and maintaining formal models, but are not content to build them as they believe
    they consume too much time and resources, even believing in the slim chances of
    success of projects that do not use some modeling [\[9\]](#page-14-4).


    The implications of this view for the construction and maintenance of programs
    and the use and application of development methods and tools are discussed.'

    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is now a cornerstone of requirements

    automation. One compelling factor behind the growing adoption of NLP in

    Requirements Engineering (RE) is the prevalent use of natural language (NL) for

    specifying requirements in industry. NLP techniques are commonly used for

    automatically classifying requirements, extracting important information, e.g.,

    domain models and glossary terms, and performing quality assurance tasks, such

    as ambiguity handling and completeness checking. With so many different NLP

    solution strategies available and the possibility of applying machine learning

    alongside, it can be challenging to choose the right strategy for a specific RE

    task and to evaluate the resulting solution in an empirically rigorous manner.

    In this chapter, we present guidelines for the selection of NLP techniques as

    well as for their evaluation in the context of RE. In particular, we discuss

    how to choose among different strategies such as traditional NLP, feature-based

    machine learning, and language-model-based methods. Our ultimate hope for this

    chapter is to serve as a stepping stone, assisting newcomers to NLP4RE in

    quickly initiating themselves into the NLP technologies most pertinent to the

    RE field.


    ## Introduction

    NLP''s role in requirements automation is pivotal, due to the widespread use of
    natural language (NL) in industrial requirements specifications. Historically,
    NL has posed challenges for requirements analysis because of its inherent proneness
    to defects such as incompleteness and ambiguity. Recent breakthroughs in NLP,
    e.g., the emergence of large language models, have nonetheless drastically enhanced
    our ability to automatically analyze textual information. This development is
    poised to even further amplify the adoption and influence of NL in requirements
    engineering.


    Due to the rapid advancement of NLP, newcomers to NLP4RE may feel overwhelmed
    by the numerous potentially applicable technologies. Another challenge is the
    necessity to empirically assess a proposed automation solution, ensuring proper
    optimization, and, where applicable, improve performance over existing solutions.


    Over the past several years, we have studied various requirements automation problems,
    including checking compliance with requirements templates [\[5\]](#page-20-0),
    glossary construction [\[7\]](#page-20-1), model extraction [\[6\]](#page-20-2),
    requirements demarcation [\[2\]](#page-20-3), ambiguity handling [\[19\]](#page-21-0),
    and question answering [\[20\]](#page-21-1). With the benefit of hindsight, this
    chapter aims to reflect on our research process and offer our collective insights
    into how we approach NLP4RE problems. Before we start, we need to emphasize that
    our perspective is retrospective. Given the fast pace of progress in NLP technologies,
    new considerations may surface, and existing technologies could become outdated.
    Therefore, it is important for readers to consider the time this chapter was written
    (2023) when dealing with new technologies. This advice applies to most works in
    the fast-changing field of Applied AI.


    Structure. Section [2](#page-1-0) outlines the steps for automating pre-processing,
    analysis, and post-processing in NLP4RE. Section [3](#page-6-0) describes various
    NLP techniques and discusses their key considerations for automation in RE. Finally,
    Section [4](#page-20-4) summarizes the chapter and presents conclusions.'

    \ users may browse, purchase,\ndownload, and install software applications. By\
    \ far, the best known app stores\nare associated with mobile platforms, such as\
    \ Google Play for Android and\nApple's App Store for iOS. The ubiquity of smartphones\
    \ has led to mobile app\nstores becoming a touchstone experience of modern living.\
    \ However, most of app\nstore research has concentrated on properties of the apps\
    \ rather than the\nstores themselves. Today, there is a rich diversity of app\
    \ stores and these\nstores have largely been overlooked by researchers: app stores\
    \ exist on many\ndistinctive platforms, are aimed at different classes of users,\
    \ and have\ndifferent end-goals beyond simply selling a standalone app to a smartphone\n\
    user.\n  We survey and characterize the broader dimensionality of app stores,\
    \ and\nexplore how and why they influence software development practices, such\
    \ as\nsystem design and release management. We begin by collecting a set of app\
    \ store\nexamples from web search queries. By analyzing and curating the results,\
    \ we\nderive a set of features common to app stores. We then build a dimensional\n\
    model of app stores based on these features, and we fit each app store from our\n\
    web search result set into this model. Next, we performed unsupervised\nclustering\
    \ to the app stores to find their natural groupings. Our results\nsuggest that\
    \ app stores have become an essential stakeholder in modern software\ndevelopment.\
    \ They control the distribution channel to end users and ensure that\nthe applications\
    \ are of suitable quality; in turn, this leads to developers\nadhering to various\
    \ store guidelines when creating their applications. However,\nwe found the app\
    \ stores operational model could vary widely between stores, and\nthis variability\
    \ could in turn affect the generalizability of existing\nunderstanding of app\
    \ stores.\n\n## Introduction\nThe widespread proliferation of smartphones and\
    \ other mobile devices in recent years has in turn produced an immense demand\
    \ for applications that run on these platforms. In response, online \"app stores\"\
    \ such as Google Play and Apple's App Store have emerged to facilitate the discovery,\
    \ purchasing, installation, and management of apps by users on their mobile devices.\
    \ The success of mobile app stores has enabled a new and more direct relationship\
    \ between app creators and users. The app store serves as a conduit between software\
    \ creators (often, developers) and their users, with some mediation provided by\
    \ the app store. The app store provides a \"one-stop shopping\" experience for\
    \ users, who can compare competing products and read reviews of other users. The\
    \ app store might also acts as a quality gatekeeper for the platform, providing\
    \ varying levels of guarantees about the apps, such as easy installation and removal,\
    \ expected functionality, and malware protection. To the software creator, the\
    \ app store provides a centralized marketplace for their app, where potential\
    \ users can find, purchase, and acquire the app easily; the app store also relieves\
    \ the developer from basic support problems related to distribution and installation,\
    \ since apps must be shown to install easily during the required approval process.\
    \ Indeed, one of the key side effects of mobile app stores is that it has forced\
    \ software developers to streamline their release management practices and ensure\
    \ hassle-free deployment at the user's end.\n\nThe success of mobile app stores\
    \ has also led to the establishment of a plethora of other kinds of app store,\
    \ often for non-mobile platforms, serving diverse kinds of user communities, offering\
    \ different kinds of services, and using a variety of monetization strategies.\
    \ Many technical platforms now operate in a store-centric way: essential services\
    \ and functionality are provided by the platform while access to extensions/add-ons\
    \ is offered only through interaction with the app store. For instance, Google\
    \ Play, the app store, operates on top of the technical platform Android, which\
    \ provides the runtime environment for the applications. When new technical platforms\
    \ are introduced, an app store is often expected to serve as a means to host and\
    \ deliver products to its users [1]. Example technical platforms that use app\
    \ store-like approaches\n\ninclude Steam [2], GitHub Marketplace [3], the Chrome\
    \ Web Store [4], Word-Press [5], AutoDesk [6], DockerHub [7], Amazon Web Services\
    \ (AWS) [8], Homebrew [9], or Ubuntu Packages [10].\n\nFor platforms that operate\
    \ in this way, the app store is an essential part of the platform's design. For\
    \ example, consider source code editors, such as VSCode and IntelliJ. The tool\
    \ itself — which we consider to be a technical platform in this context — offers\
    \ the essential functionality of a modern source code editor; however, many additional\
    \ services are available through the associated app store that are not included\
    \ by default. Thus, extensions that allow for language-specific syntax highlighting\
    \ or version control integration must be added manually by the user through interaction\
    \ with the tool's app store. We conjecture that the app store has fundamentally\
    \ changed how some classes of software systems are designed, from the overall\
    \ ecosystem architecture of the technical platform to the way in which add-ons\
    \ are engineered to fit within its instances.\n\nIn this work, we will explore\
    \ the general space of app stores, and also consider how app store-centric design\
    \ can affect software development practices. Previous research involving app stores\
    \ has focused mainly on mobile app stores, often concentrating on properties of\
    \ the apps rather than properties of the stores. For example, Harman et al. performed\
    \ one of the first major studies of app stores in 2012, focusing on the BlackBerry\
    \ App World [11]. However, concentrating the investigative scope so narrowly may\
    \ lead to claims that do not generalize well across the space of all app stores.\
    \ For example, Lin et al. found that reviews of games that appeared in mobile\
    \ app stores differed significantly from the reviews of the same game that appeared\
    \ within the Steam platform's own app store [12]. In our work, we aim to take\
    \ a more holistic approach to studying app stores by considering both mobile and\
    \ non-mobile variants. In so doing, we hope to create a more general model of\
    \ app stores that fits this broader space.\n\nTo achieve a holistic view, we start\
    \ from the definition of an app store. A precise definition of the term \"app\
    \ store\" has been omitted in much of the previous research in this area. Currently,\
    \ Google Play and Apple's App Store dominate the market and are the main targets\
    \ of research on app stores; in the past, the BlackBerry App World and Microsoft's\
    \ Windows Phone Store were also important players, but these stores are now defunct.<sup>1</sup>\
    \ Wikipedia recognizes Electronic AppWrapper [13] as the first true platform-specific\
    \ electronic marketplace for software applications, but the term became popular\
    \ when Apple introduced its App Store along with the iPhone 3G in 2008. Since\
    \ then, the term has largely come to refer to any centralized store for mobile\
    \ applications. We present our own working definition of the term \"app store\"\
    \ in Sec. 2.4.\n\nThe goal of this work is to survey and characterize the broader\
    \ dimensionality of app stores, and also to explore how and why they may feed\
    \ back into software development practices, such as release management. As a step\
    \ toward\n\n<sup>1</sup> The Windows Phone Store was absorbed into the broader\
    \ Windows Store in 2015.\n\nthis goal, we focus on two research questions (RQs)\

    incremental backup of the data within the system. What distinguishes Next4 is

    the way that the data is backed up, improving both space utilization as well as

    NVM is used as a new hierarchy in the storage system, due to its intermediate

    problems emerge when we attempt to put DRAM, NVM, and disk together as an

    efficient whole. In this paper, we discuss the challenging consistency problems

    ## Introduction

    With the emergence of non-volatile memory (NVM), various works have been proposed
    to leverage its byte-addressable and persistence characteristics. Among these
    approaches, the most compatible, efficient, and promising one is to use NVM to
    accelerate existing disk file systems [\[5\]](#page-7-0), [\[8\]](#page-8-0),
    [\[11\]](#page-8-1), in which case users can utilize NVM in their current system
    transparently without migration cost. However, we discover that the heterogeneity
    between DRAM, NVM, and disk makes it harder for these works to fully exploit the
    potential of NVM.


    NVPC [\[8\]](#page-8-0) is the only one of the accelerators that precisely accelerates
    only the slow path, i.e. sync writes, of the legacy storage stack, with no slow-down
    to its lower file system. We notice that its implementation abandons the layered
    design adopted by previous work, introducing an on-demand sync absorbing mechanism,
    which is the fundamental of its high efficiency. However, this design also introduces
    consistency

    problems between NVM and disk, which are only briefly and insufficiently discussed
    in that work. We observe that this consistency problem is common to a heterogeneous
    storage system with different write sequences and access granularity. Thus we
    believe that it is necessary to further discuss the consistency problems in such
    systems.


    In this work, we will first introduce the background of NVM-based heterogeneous
    storage systems. Then based on NVPC, we will discuss the consistency problems
    and solutions. Specifically, for each heterogeneous characteristic, we will first
    figure out the exact problems that the system is facing. Then we will analyze
    the causes of the consistency problems. Finally, we will provide the solutions
    to each problem based on our analysis.'

    trajectory, which includes the rapid obsolescence of frameworks due to business

    and technical constraints, a move towards specialized systems and models, and

    varying approaches to centralized and decentralized control. This comprehensive

    ## Introduction

    The Internet, the expansive computational backbone of interactive machines, is
    largely responsible for the 21st century''s social, financial, and technological
    growth [\[1\]](#page-39-0). The growing reliance on the computing resources it
    encapsulates has pushed the complexity and scope of such platforms, leading to
    the development of innovative computing systems. These systems have genuinely
    improved the capabilities and expectations of computing equipment driven by rapid
    technical and user-driven evolution [\[2\]](#page-40-0). For instance, vintage
    mainframes combined centralized data processing and storage with transmission
    interfaces for user input. Due to advancements in clusters and packet-switching
    technologies, microchip gadgets, and graphical user interfaces, technology originally
    shifted from big, centrally-run mainframe computers to Personal Computers (PCs).
    The globalization of network standards made it possible for interconnected networks
    worldwide to communicate and share data [\[3\]](#page-40-1). Businesses slowly
    combined sensor and actuator goals with built-in network connectivity by creating
    architectures and standards that submit tasks to remote pools of computing resources,
    such as memory, storage, and data processing [\[4\]](#page-40-2). As a result,
    newer models like the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing are now beginning
    to expand the reach of technology outside the confines of traditional network
    nodes [\[5\]](#page-40-3).


    Over the past six decades, computing models have fundamentally shifted to address
    the problems posed by the ever-evolving nature of our civilization and its associated
    computer system architectures [\[6\]](#page-40-4). The evolution of computing
    from mainframes to workstations to the cloud to autonomous and decentralized architectures,
    such as edge computing and IoT technologies, however, maintains identical core
    parts and traits that characterize their function [\[7\]](#page-40-5). Research
    in computing underpins all of them! Advancements in areas like security, computer
    hardware acceleration, edge computing, and energy efficiency typically serve as
    catalysts for innovation and entrepreneurship that span across various business
    domains [\[8\]](#page-40-6). While computing systems and other forms of system
    integration create new problems/opportunities, software frameworks have been developed
    to address them. Thus, middleware, network protocols, and safe segregation techniques
    must be continually developed and refined to support novel computing systems—and
    their innovative use cases.'

    HPC and Cloud have evolved independently, specializing their innovations into

    performance or productivity. Acceleration as a Service (XaaS) is a recipe to

    empower both fields with a shared execution platform that provides transparent

    access to computing resources, regardless of the underlying cloud or HPC

    service provider. Bridging HPC and cloud advancements, XaaS presents a unified

    architecture built on performance-portable containers. Our converged model

    concentrates on low-overhead, high-performance communication and computing,

    targeting resource-intensive workloads from climate simulations to machine

    learning. XaaS lifts the restricted allocation model of Function-as-a-Service

    (FaaS), allowing users to benefit from the flexibility and efficient resource

    utilization of serverless while supporting long-running and

    performance-sensitive workloads from HPC.


    ## Introduction

    Acceleration as a Service (XaaS) is a recipe for enabling high-performance computing
    (HPC) workloads in the cloud. Cloud computing ("the Cloud") provides the opportunity
    to offer computational capabilities as a simple transactional service, similar
    to how we use electricity or the internet. Today''s Cloud already offers a wide
    range of powerful services, from online storage to specific applications


    ![](_page_0_Picture_16.jpeg)


    such as video calls or search. However, its performance is limited by inefficiencies
    in current Cloud architectures. XaaS addresses those inefficiencies and enables
    the computation of high-performance accelerated workloads, ranging from simulations
    to AI/ML inference and training, as a high-performance cloud service capable of
    serving most demanding workloads.


    XaaS provides different opportunities for people with different backgrounds and
    mindsets. Members of the HPC community will find a vision for productive high-performance
    computing connecting today''s manually compiled-and-run HPC applications to a
    new world of automated high-performance containers running finegrained transactional
    computations. Members of the datacenter systems and cloud computing communities
    will find a vision for lifting standard container deployments seamlessly to low-overhead,
    high-performance accelerated infrastructures, enabling the fastest communication
    and specialized computing at the highest system utilization and reliability, whereby
    deployed containers utilize library interfaces and remote direct memory access
    (RDMA) technologies for specialized acceleration and communication with close-to-zero
    overheads compared to traditional bare-metal deployments.


    Here, we define HPC workloads as resource-intensive and performance sensitive
    applications. Traditionally, HPC systems were aimed at executing extremely demanding
    scientific computing workloads. Recently, HPC systems have also been employed
    for data analytics, machine learning, and other workloads that, like scientific
    computing, require massive concurrency and rapid interprocess communication. Supercomputing
    is the subset of HPC that uses the fastest and most powerful general purpose scientific
    computing systems available at any given time [\[7\]](#page-7-0). Cloud computing
    can be characterized by the desire to separate provider and user by a simple,
    clear, and automatable interface (ideally as simple as a power socket!) and by
    business and operations models designed to ensure that user requests can always
    be satisfied. To this end, cloud computing employs composable (micro)services
    that run in containers and interact through clearly defined interfaces (e.g.,
    REST, JSON) that often however compromise performance.


    Applications that only rely on container and cloud service interfaces are called
    "cloud native." Container creation, deployment, and management are largely handled
    by the de-facto standards Docker and Kubernetes. However, cloud service interfaces
    such as storage or machine learning inference are usually specific to the provider''s
    ecosystem. Most modern cloud systems aim to offer

    Figure 1: Both Cloud and HPC converge to containers as an application and service
    deployment model. Containers bind all dependencies and system aspects (users,
    rights, etc.) into a single portable unit that can be flexibly deployed. XaaS
    enables HPC features for such containers.


    an execution environment for cloud-native containers, which is similar to an operating
    system''s interface to a process. The Cloud Native Foundation seeks to define
    an interface in the spirit of the POSIX interfaces[a](#page-1-0) . This design
    is traditionally aimed at providing a productive ecosystem. Only recently, performance
    has become a center of attention when using compute accelerators for demanding
    video processing tasks or AI/ML workloads. Thus, the goals of modern cloud computing
    and HPC align well and could converge towards the same infrastructure.


    HPC and Cloud have progressed largely independently in the past. Both according
    to their specialization: The Cloud innovates in terms of business model, software
    packaging (containers), and productive ecosystems (e.g., cloud native) and HPC
    in terms of performance (e.g., RDMA) and abstractions for performance (performance
    libraries). However, each field trails the other in other respects: for example,
    HPC has explored as-aservices abstractions [\[1\]](#page-7-1) and is only just
    beginning to embrace the simpler deployment philosophy of containerized environments,
    while cloud started to explore ideas of RDMA. Each feature was established in
    the other community a decade ago. XaaS provides a way to accelerate this transition
    to a common architecture based on high-performance containers. Figure [1](#page-1-1)
    shows a schematic overview of where each field is coming from and what containerized
    deployments could enable today or in the near future. If those two communities
    do not join forces, they are bound to re-invent each other''s methods.


    All-in-all, the high-level architectural vision for a converged high-performance
    cloud with XaaS is based on three fundamental principles:'

    The concept of structured occurrence nets is an extension of that of

    occurrence nets which are directed acyclic graphs that represent causality and

    concurrency information concerning a single execution of a distributed system.

    The formalism of structured occurrence nets has been introduced to facilitate

    the portrayal and analysis of the behaviours, and in particular failures, of

    complex evolving systems. Such systems are composed of a large number of

    sub-systems which may proceed concurrently and interact with each other and

    with the external environment while their behaviour is subject to modification

    by other systems. The purpose of this paper is to provide an extension of

    structured occurrence nets to include models built up of acyclic nets rather

    than occurrence nets.


    ## Introduction

    The concept of structured occurrence nets [\[16,](#page-34-0)[20\]](#page-34-1)
    is an extension of that of occurrence nets [\[11\]](#page-34-2) which are directed
    acyclic graphs (a subclass of Petri nets) that represent causality and concurrency
    information concerning a single execution of a distributed system. The formalism
    of structured occurrence nets has been introduced to facilitate the portrayal
    and analysis of the behaviours, and in particular failures, of complex evolving
    systems. Examples include a large hardware system which suffers component break-downs,
    reconfigurations and replacements, a large distributed system whose software is
    being continually updated (or patched), a gang of criminals whose membership is
    changing, and an operational railway system that is being extended. (In these
    latter cases we are regarding crimes and accidents as types of failure.) The underlying
    idea of a structured occurrence net is to combine multiple related occurrence
    nets by using various formal relationships (in particular, abstractions) in order
    to express dependencies among the component occurrence nets. By means of these
    relations, a structured occurrence net is able to portray a more explicit view
    of system activity, involving various types of communication between subsystems,
    and of system upgrades, reconfigurations and replacements than is possible with
    an occurrence net, so allowing one to document and exploit behavioural knowledge
    of (actual or envisaged) complex evolving systems.


    Communication structured occurrence nets are a basic variant of structured occurrence
    nets that enable the explicit representation of synchronous and asynchronous interaction
    between communicating subsystems. A communication structured occurrence net is
    composed of a set of distinct component occurrence nets representing separate


    subsystems. When it is determined that there is a potential for an interaction
    between subsystems, an asynchronous or synchronous communication link can be made
    between events in the different subsystems'' occurrence nets via a channel/buffer
    place.


    Another variant of structured occurrence nets, behavioural structured occurrence
    nets, conveys information about the evolution of individual systems. They use
    a two level view to represent an execution history, with the lower level providing
    details of its behaviours during the different evolution stages represented in
    the upper level view. Thus a behavioural structured occurrence net gives information
    about the evolution of an individual system, and the phases of the overall activity
    are used to represent each successive stage of the evolution of this system.


    This document extends and systematises the ideas contained in [\[16\]](#page-34-0),
    after allowing backward non-determinism and forward non-determinism in the representation
    of the components of a complex evolving system. This is achieved by replacing
    occurrence nets with more general acyclic nets. As a result, it leads to communication
    structured acyclic nets and behavioural structured acyclic nets generalising previously
    introduced models.'

    One relevant aspect in the development of the Semantic Web framework is the

    achievement of a real inter-agents communication capability at the semantic

    level. The agents should be able to communicate and understand each other using

    standard communication protocols freely, that is, without needing a laborious
    a

    priori preparation, before the communication takes place. For that setting we

    present in this paper a proposal that promotes to describe standard

    communication protocols using Semantic Web technology (specifically, OWL-DL and

    SWRL). Those protocols are constituted by communication acts. In our proposal

    those communication acts are described as terms that belong to a communication

    acts ontology, that we have developed, called CommOnt. The intended semantics

    associated to the communication acts in the ontology is expressed through

    social commitments that are formalized as fluents in the Event Calculus. In

    summary, OWL-DL reasoners and rule engines help in our proposal for reasoning

    about protocols. We define some comparison relationships (dealing with notions

    of equivalence and specialization) between protocols used by agents from

    different systems.


    ## Introduction

    In the scenario that promotes the emergent Web, administrators of existing Information
    Systems, that belong to nodes distributed along the Internet network, are encouraged
    to provide the functionalities of those systems through agents that represent
    them or through Web Services. The underlying idea is to get a real interoperation
    among those Information Systems in order to enlarge the benefits that users can
    get from the Web by increasing the machine processable tasks.

    de Gipuzkoa (cosupported by the European Social Fund) and the Spanish Ministry
    of Education and Science TIN2007-68091-C02-01.


    Although agent technology and Web Services technology have been developed in a
    separate way, there exists a recent work of several members from both communities
    trying to consolidate their approaches into a common specification describing
    how to seamlessly interconnect FIPA compliant agent systems [\[1\]](#page-13-0)
    with W3C compliant Web Services. The purpose of specifying an infrastructure for
    integrating these two technologies is to provide a common means of allowing each
    to discover and invoke instances of the other [\[2\]](#page-13-1). Considering
    the previous approach, in the rest of this paper we will only concentrate on inter-agent
    communication aspects.


    Communication among agents is in general based on the interchange of communication
    acts. However, different Information Systems have incorporated different classes
    of communication acts as their Agent Communication Language (acl) to the point
    that they do not understand each other. Moreover, protocols play a relevant role
    in agents communication. A protocol specifies the rules of interaction between
    agents by restricting the range of allowed follow-up communication acts for each
    agent at any stage during a communicative interaction. It is widely recognized
    the interest of using standard communication protocols.


    We advocate so that the administrators of the Information Systems proceed in the
    following way. When they wish to implement the agents that will represent their
    systems, they first select, from a repository of standard protocols (there can
    exist one or more repositories), those protocols that fulfill the goals of their
    agents. Sometimes a single protocol will be sufficient and other times it will
    be necessary to design a protocol as a composition of some other protocols. Next,
    they can customize the selected protocols before they incorporate them to the
    agents. In that setting, when agents of different Information Systems want to
    interoperate it will be relevant to reason about the protocols embedded in the
    agents in order to discover relationships such as equivalence or restriction between
    them. Moreover, once those relationships are discovered both agents can use the
    same protocol by replacing dynamically in one agent the protocol supported by
    the other. Finally, in our opinion it will be desirable to use a formal language
    to represent the protocols.


    In this paper we present a proposal that promotes to describe standard communication
    protocols using Semantic Web Technology (OWL-DL and SWRL). In addition, communication
    acts that take part of the protocols are described as terms that belong to a communication
    acts ontology, that we have developed, called CommOnt (see more details about
    the ontology in [\[3\]](#page-13-2)). The use of that ontology favours on the
    one hand, the explicit representation of the meaning of the communication acts
    and on the other hand, the customization of existing standard protocols by allowing
    the use of particular communication acts that can be defined as specializations
    of existing standard communication acts.


    Terms of the CommOnt ontology are described using OWL-DL and we have adopted the
    so called social approach [\[4,](#page-13-3)[5\]](#page-13-4) for expressing the
    intended semantics of the communication acts included in the protocols. According
    to the social approach, when agents interact they become involved in social commitments
    or obligations to each other. Those commitments are public, and therefore they
    are suitable for an objective and verifiable semantics of agent interaction. Social
    commitments can be considered as fluents in the Event Calculus, which is a logic-based
    formalism for representing actions and their effects. Fluents are propositions
    that hold during time intervals. A formula in the Event Calculus is associated
    to a communication act for describing its social effects. The set of fluents that
    hold at a moment describes a state of the interaction. DL axioms and Event Calculus
    formulae apply to different facets of communication acts. DL axioms describe static
    features and are principally used for communication act interpretation purposes.
    Event Calculus formulae describe dynamic features, namely the social effects of
    communication acts, and are principally used for communication act operational
    contexts such as supervising conversations.


    In summary the main contributions of the proposal presented in this paper are:


    - It favours a flexible interoperation among agents of different systems by using
    standard communication protocols described through tools promoted by the W3C.

    - It facilitates the customization of those standard communication protocols allowing
    to use communication acts in the protocols that belong to specific acl of Information
    Systems. The particular communication acts are described in an ontology.

    - It provides a basis to reason about relationships between two protocols in such
    a way that the following relations can be discovered: equivalence or restriction
    (and also considering a notion of specialization). Moreover, notice that our approach
    allows to get protocols classification in terms of the intended semantics of communication
    acts that appear in the protocols.

    - It allows modeling the communication among agents without regarding only to
    the lower level operational details of how communication acts are interchanged
    but taking also into account the meaning of those acts.


    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section [2](#page-2-0) provides
    background on the communication ontology, that contains terms corresponding to
    communication acts that appear in the protocols, and on the semantics associated
    to those acts. Section [3](#page-6-0) explains how protocols are described using
    Semantic Web Technology and presents the definitions of the relationships considered
    between protocols. Section [4](#page-11-0) discusses different related works,
    and conclusions appear in the last section.'
